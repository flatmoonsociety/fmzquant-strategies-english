Close all futures positions under this trading pair.
How to close a position: Taking a long position that has been closed as an example, keep placing a sell one and then cancel it after 0.5 seconds. Continue to place a sell one until the position is completely closed. The amount of each pending order is all current positions that can be closed.
The plug-in can be launched with one click on the trading terminal, free of charge, and convenient for manual trading. Detailed introduction: https://www.fmz.com/digest-topic/5051
