#### Overview
This strategy is an intelligent trading system based on the identification of price fluctuation peaks. The strategy monitors price fluctuations on the 1-hour K-line chart and triggers trading signals when there are significant rising or falling spikes. The system uses a fixed investment amount of 30,000 USDT and automatically calculates the number of transactions based on the current market price to achieve the optimal allocation of funds.
#### Strategy Principle
The core of the strategy is to identify price fluctuation spikes through the detect_spike function. When the price fluctuates greater than 0.62%, the system determines it as a valid trading signal. Specifically include:
1. Determination of rising peak: when (highest price-closing price)/closing price >= 0.62%
2. Determination of falling peak: when (closing price - lowest price)/closing price >= 0.62%
The strategy adopts a fixed take-profit rate of 0.42% and a stop-loss rate of 1%. After the signal is triggered, the transaction is automatically executed and the corresponding take-profit and stop-loss levels are set.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Clear signals: Calculating fluctuation peaks through strict mathematical models, the trading signals are clear and objective
2. Risk controllable: Use fixed stop loss and take profit ratios to effectively control the risk of each transaction
3. Fund management optimization: use fixed investment amounts and dynamically calculate the number of transactions to improve fund utilization efficiency
4. High degree of automation: the system automatically identifies signals, executes transactions, and manages positions, reducing human intervention.
5. Strong adaptability: strategy parameters can be optimized and adjusted according to market conditions
#### Strategy Risk
1. Market fluctuation risk: False signals may appear in violently volatile markets
2. Slippage risk: the actual transaction price may deviate from the signal price
3. Liquidity risk: Large transactions may face insufficient liquidity problems
4. Technical risk: System operation may be affected by technical factors such as network delay
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce multi-period confirmation: combine signals from multiple time periods for cross-validation
2. Dynamic adjustment of optimization parameters: adaptively adjust strategy parameters according to market volatility
3. Add market sentiment indicators: introduce auxiliary indicators such as trading volume and trend strength
4. Improve risk control: increase risk control measures such as drawdown control and position time limit
5. Optimize fund management: introduce dynamic position management and compound interest mechanism
#### Summary
This strategy identifies market opportunities through rigorous mathematical models and combines it with a complete risk control system to achieve stable trading returns. The strategy has good scalability and optimization space, and can adapt to different market environments through continuous improvement. It is a quantitative trading strategy with practical value.  ||
#### Overview
This strategy is an intelligent trading system based on price volatility spike detection. The strategy monitors price movements on the 1-hour candlestick chart and triggers trading signals when significant upward or downward spikes occur. The system uses a fixed investment amount of 30,000 USDT and automatically calculates trading quantities based on current market prices to achieve optimal capital allocation.

#### Strategy Principle
The core of the strategy is to identify price volatility spikes through the detect_spike function. When price movement exceeds 0.62%, the system determines it as a valid trading signal. Specifically includes:
1. Bullish spike determination: when (high price - closing price)/closing price >= 0.62%
2. Bearish spike determination: when (closing price - low price)/closing price >= 0.62%
The strategy adopts a fixed take-profit rate of 0.42% and stop-loss rate of 1%, automatically executing trades and setting corresponding profit and loss levels after triggering signals.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Clear signals: Calculates volatility spikes through strict mathematical models, providing clear and objective trading signals
2. Controlled risk: Uses fixed stop-loss and take-profit ratios to effectively control risk for each trade
3. Optimized capital management: Uses fixed investment amounts and dynamically calculates trading quantities for improved capital efficiency
4. High automation: System automatically identifies signals, executes trades, and manages positions, reducing human intervention
5. Strong adaptability: Strategy parameters can be optimized and adjusted according to market conditions

#### Strategy Risks
1. Market volatility risk: False signals may occur in highly volatile markets
2. Slippage risk: Actual execution prices may deviate from signal prices
3. Liquidity risk: Large trades may face insufficient liquidity issues
4. Technical risk: System operation may be affected by network latency and other technical factors

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce multi-period confirmation: Cross-validate signals using multiple time periods
2. Optimize parameter dynamic adjustment: Adaptively adjust strategy parameters based on market volatility
3. Add market sentiment indicators: Incorporate auxiliary indicators such as trading volume and trend strength
4. Improve risk control: Add drawdown control, position time limits and other risk management measures
5. Optimize capital management: Introduce dynamic position management and compound interest mechanisms

#### Summary
The strategy identifies market opportunities through rigorous mathematical models and combines a comprehensive risk control system to achieve stable trading returns. The strategy has good scalability and optimization potential, and through continuous improvement can adapt to different market environments, making it a practical quantitative trading strategy.[/trans]
