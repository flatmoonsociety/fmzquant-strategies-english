#### Overview
This strategy is an intelligent trading system based on the dual momentum indicators of RSI and stochastic RSI. This strategy captures potential trading opportunities by combining signals from two momentum oscillators to identify overbought and oversold market conditions. The system supports cycle adaptation and can flexibly adjust the trading cycle according to different market environments.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy is based on the following key elements:
1. Calculate price momentum using the 14-period RSI indicator
2. Use the 14-period random RSI for secondary confirmation.
3. When RSI is below 35 and Stochastic RSI is below 20, a buy signal is triggered
4. When RSI is above 70 and Stochastic RSI is above 80, a sell signal is triggered
5. Perform 3-period smoothing on random RSI through SMA to improve signal stability
6. Supports free switching between daily and weekly cycles
#### Strategic Advantages
1. The dual signal confirmation mechanism greatly reduces the interference of false signals.
2. Indicator parameters can be flexibly adjusted according to market fluctuations and have strong adaptability.
3. Using SMA smoothing processing to effectively reduce signal noise
4. Supports multi-cycle trading to meet the needs of different investors
5. The visual interface intuitively displays buying and selling signals to facilitate analysis and decision-making.
6. The code structure is clear, easy to maintain and secondary development
#### Strategy Risk
1. A volatile market may generate too many trading signals
2. Signal lag may occur when the trend turns sharply
3. Improper parameter settings may lead to missed trading opportunities
4. False signals may appear during periods of high market volatility
5. Stop loss needs to be set appropriately to control risks
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce trend judgment indicators, such as MACD or EMA, to improve signal reliability
2. Increase trading volume factor and improve signal quality
3. Add dynamic stop loss mechanism to optimize risk management
4. Develop an adaptive parameter optimization system to improve strategy stability
5. Consider introducing market volatility indicators to optimize trading opportunities
#### Summary
This strategy builds a reliable trading system by combining the advantages of RSI and Stochastic RSI. The dual signal confirmation mechanism effectively reduces false signals, while flexible parameter settings provide strong adaptability. Through continuous optimization and improvement, this strategy is expected to maintain stable performance in various market environments. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is an intelligent trading system based on dual momentum indicators: RSI and Stochastic RSI. It identifies market overbought and oversold conditions by combining signals from two momentum oscillators, capturing potential trading opportunities. The system supports period adaptation and can flexibly adjust trading cycles according to different market environments.

#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy is based on the following key elements:
1. Uses 14-period RSI indicator to calculate price momentum
2. Employs 14-period Stochastic RSI for secondary confirmation
3. Triggers buy signal when RSI is below 35 and Stochastic RSI is below 20
4. Triggers sell signal when RSI is above 70 and Stochastic RSI is above 80
5. Applies 3-period SMA smoothing to Stochastic RSI for signal stability
6. Supports switching between daily and weekly timeframes

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dual signal confirmation mechanism significantly reduces false signal interference
2. Indicator parameters can be flexibly adjusted to market volatility
3. SMA smoothing effectively reduces signal noise
4. Supports multi-period trading to meet different investors' needs
5. Visual interface intuitively displays buy/sell signals for analysis
6. Clear code structure, easy to maintain and develop further

#### Strategy Risks
1. May generate excessive trading signals in sideways markets
2. Potential signal lag during rapid trend reversals
3. Improper parameter settings may lead to missed trading opportunities
4. False signals may occur during high market volatility
5. Requires proper stop-loss settings for risk control

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce trend judgment indicators like MACD or EMA to improve signal reliability
2. Add volume factors to enhance signal quality
3. Implement dynamic stop-loss mechanisms to optimize risk management
4. Develop adaptive parameter optimization system for strategy stability
5. Consider incorporating market volatility indicators to optimize trading timing

#### Summary
The strategy builds a reliable trading system by combining the advantages of RSI and Stochastic RSI. The dual signal confirmation mechanism effectively reduces false signals, while flexible parameter settings provide strong adaptability. Through continuous optimization and improvement, the strategy shows promise in maintaining stable performance across various market conditions.[/trans]
