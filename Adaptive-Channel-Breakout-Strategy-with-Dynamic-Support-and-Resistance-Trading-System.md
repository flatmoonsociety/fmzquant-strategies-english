#### Overview
This strategy is an advanced support and resistance based trading system that combines dynamic trend channels with risk management features. The strategy identifies key support and resistance levels by analyzing the highest and lowest points of price fluctuations within a specific lookback period, and uses channel width parameters to construct dynamic trading ranges, providing traders with a clear view of market structure and precise trading signals.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy includes the following key elements:
1. Support and resistance levels are calculated based on the lowest and highest prices within the user-defined lookback period.
2. Set the dynamic channel width through percentage parameters, and build upper and lower channels based on support and resistance levels.
3. A buy signal is triggered when the price is close to the support level (within 1% of the support level)
4. The system automatically calculates stop loss and take profit levels based on the percentage set by the user.
5. Trades are only executed within the specified backtest time frame
6. Calculate and display the risk-benefit ratio in real time to help traders evaluate the potential returns and risks of each transaction.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Strong adaptability: support and resistance levels will be dynamically adjusted with market changes to adapt to different market environments.
2. Improved risk management: integrated calculation and visual display of stop loss, take profit and risk-return ratio
3. Clear trading signals: Provide clear entry signals and reduce the impact of subjective judgments
4. Excellent visualization effect: various price levels are intuitively displayed through lines and labels of different colors.
5. Flexible and adjustable parameters: allows users to adjust various parameters according to personal trading style and market characteristics.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Market volatility risk: too many trading signals may be triggered in highly volatile markets
2. Risk of false breakthrough: A false breakthrough may occur when the price is close to the support level, resulting in false signals.
3. Parameter sensitivity: The settings of lookback period and channel width have a greater impact on strategy performance.
4. One-way trading restrictions: The current strategy only supports long transactions, and you may miss short-selling opportunities.
5. Time dependence: The strategy effect is limited to the specified backtest time range
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Add trend filter: introduce moving average or momentum indicator to filter out counter-trend signals
2. Improve the trading direction: add short trading logic to improve the comprehensiveness of the strategy
3. Optimize signal generation: combine with trading volume indicators to verify the effectiveness of price breakthroughs
4. Dynamic stop loss setting: dynamically adjust the stop loss distance based on ATR or volatility
5. Increase position management: dynamically adjust position size based on risk-return ratio and market volatility
#### Summary
This strategy builds a logically rigorous and risk-controllable trading system by combining the key concepts in technical analysis - support, resistance levels and trend channels. The advantage of the strategy lies in its adaptability and complete risk management, but it still requires traders to carefully adjust parameters based on market conditions and personal risk tolerance. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy has room for further improvement and can be developed into a more comprehensive and robust trading system.

#### Overview
This strategy is an advanced trading system based on support and resistance levels, combining dynamic trend channels with risk management functionality. The strategy identifies key support and resistance levels by analyzing price fluctuations' highs and lows over a specified lookback period, and utilizes channel width parameters to construct dynamic trading ranges, providing traders with a clear market structure perspective and precise trading signals.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic includes several key elements:
1. Support and resistance levels are calculated based on the lowest and highest prices within a user-defined lookback period
2. Dynamic channel width is set through percentage parameters, building upper and lower channels based on support and resistance levels
3. Buy signals are triggered when price approaches support level (within 1% distance)
4. The system automatically calculates stop-loss and take-profit levels based on user-defined percentages
5. Trades are executed only within specified backtesting time range
6. Risk-to-reward ratios are calculated and displayed in real-time to help traders evaluate potential returns against risks

#### Strategy Advantages
1. High Adaptability: Support and resistance levels dynamically adjust with market changes, adapting to different market environments
2. Comprehensive Risk Management: Integrates stop-loss, take-profit, and risk-reward ratio calculation with visualization
3. Clear Trading Signals: Provides distinct entry signals, reducing the impact of subjective judgment
4. Excellent Visualization: Various price levels are displayed intuitively through different colored lines and labels
5. Flexible Parameters: Allows users to adjust parameters based on personal trading style and market characteristics

#### Strategy Risks
1. Market Volatility Risk: May trigger excessive trading signals in highly volatile markets
2. False Breakout Risk: Price approaching support levels may result in false breakouts leading to incorrect signals
3. Parameter Sensitivity: Strategy performance is highly dependent on lookback period and channel width settings
4. Unidirectional Trading Limitation: Currently only supports long positions, potentially missing short opportunities
5. Time Dependency: Strategy effectiveness is limited to specified backtesting time range

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Add Trend Filter: Incorporate moving averages or momentum indicators to filter out counter-trend signals
2. Complete Trading Directions: Add short trading logic to enhance strategy comprehensiveness
3. Optimize Signal Generation: Integrate volume indicators to verify price breakout validity
4. Dynamic Stop-Loss Setting: Adjust stop-loss distances dynamically based on ATR or volatility
5. Enhance Position Management: Dynamically adjust position sizes based on risk-reward ratio and market volatility

#### Summary
This strategy combines key technical analysis concepts - support/resistance levels and trend channels - to build a logically rigorous and risk-controlled trading system. The strategy's strengths lie in its adaptability and comprehensive risk management, but traders still need to carefully adjust parameters based on market conditions and personal risk tolerance. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy has room for further improvement and can develop into a more comprehensive and robust trading system.[/trans]
