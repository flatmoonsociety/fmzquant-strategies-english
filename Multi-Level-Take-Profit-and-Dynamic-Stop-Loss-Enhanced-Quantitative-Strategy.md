#### Overview
This is an enhanced quantitative trading strategy developed based on the metrobonez1ty strategy tester. The main feature of this strategy is the implementation of multi-level profit targets and dynamic stop-loss mechanisms, while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with external indicator signals. The strategy supports up to three profit target positions and can optionally use indicator-based stop loss triggers to filter trade entries with additional signal confirmation.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy revolves around a multi-level exit mechanism. In terms of entry, the strategy triggers long and short trading signals through two input sources: longEntry and shortEntry. For each trading direction, the strategy sets three independent profit targets (TP1, TP2, TP3), and each target can be dynamically adjusted based on external indicator signals. At the same time, the strategy introduces a dynamic stop-loss mechanism, which can flexibly adjust the stop-loss position according to market conditions. The strategy also implements a filtering mechanism based on confluence, which requires multiple indicators to be confirmed together to trigger transactions.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Flexible exit mechanism: supports multiple profit target positions and can gradually exit positions according to market conditions.
2. Dynamic risk management: dynamically adjust the stop loss position through external indicator signals, providing more intelligent risk control.
3. Highly customizable: The entry and exit conditions of the strategy can be customized through external indicators to adapt to different trading styles.
4. Complete filtering mechanism: Reduce the impact of false signals by requiring multiple signal confirmations.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Signal dependence risk: The strategy relies heavily on the quality of external indicator signals. If the indicator signals are inaccurate, it may lead to wrong transactions.
2. Parameter optimization risk: Multiple profit targets and stop-loss parameters need to be carefully optimized. Over-optimization may lead to over-fitting.
3. Market environment adaptability risk: Under different market environments, fixed multi-level profit targets may not be flexible enough.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Dynamic parameter adjustment: An adaptive mechanism can be introduced to automatically adjust profit targets and stop-loss parameters according to market volatility.
2. Signal quality assessment: Add a quality assessment mechanism for entry and exit signals to further improve the accuracy of transactions.
3. Position management optimization: Different position allocation ratios can be set according to different profit targets.
4. Market environment identification: Add a market environment identification module and adopt different parameter settings under different market conditions.
#### Summary
This strategy provides a comprehensive trading framework through multi-level profit targets and dynamic stop loss mechanisms. The advantage of the strategy lies in its flexibility and customizability, but it also requires careful handling of parameter optimization and market adaptability issues. Through the suggested optimization direction, the strategy can further improve its stability and adaptability and become a more complete trading system. ||
#### Overview
This is an enhanced quantitative trading strategy developed based on metrobonez1ty's strategy tester. The strategy's main features include multiple take-profit targets and dynamic stop-loss mechanisms while maintaining flexibility for integration with external indicator signals. It supports up to three profit targets and optionally uses indicator-based stop-loss triggers, filtering trade entries through additional signal confirmation.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy's core logic revolves around a multi-layered exit mechanism. For entry, the strategy uses longEntry and shortEntry input sources to trigger long and short trading signals. For each trading direction, the strategy sets up three independent take-profit targets (TP1, TP2, TP3), each of which can be dynamically adjusted based on external indicator signals. Additionally, the strategy incorporates a dynamic stop-loss mechanism that can flexibly adjust stop-loss positions according to market conditions. The strategy also implements confluence-based filtering, requiring multiple indicator confirmations to trigger trades.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Flexible Exit Mechanism: Supports multiple profit target positions, allowing gradual position exits based on market conditions.
2. Dynamic Risk Management: Adjusts stop-loss positions dynamically through external indicator signals, providing smarter risk control.
3. High Customizability: Entry and exit conditions can be customized through external indicators, adapting to different trading styles.
4. Comprehensive Filtering: Reduces the impact of false signals by requiring multiple signal confirmations.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Signal Dependency Risk: The strategy heavily relies on the quality of external indicator signals; inaccurate signals may lead to incorrect trades.
2. Parameter Optimization Risk: Multiple profit targets and stop-loss parameters require careful optimization; over-optimization may lead to overfitting.
3. Market Environment Adaptability Risk: Fixed multiple profit targets may not be flexible enough in different market environments.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Dynamic Parameter Adjustment: Introduce adaptive mechanisms to automatically adjust profit targets and stop-loss parameters based on market volatility.
2. Signal Quality Assessment: Add quality assessment mechanisms for entry and exit signals to further improve trading accuracy.
3. Position Management Optimization: Set different position allocation ratios for different profit targets.
4. Market Environment Recognition: Add market environment recognition modules to adopt different parameter settings under different market conditions.

#### Summary
The strategy provides a comprehensive trading framework through multiple profit targets and dynamic stop-loss mechanisms. Its strengths lie in its flexibility and customizability, but careful attention must be paid to parameter optimization and market adaptability issues. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy can further enhance its stability and adaptability to become a more refined trading system.[/trans]
