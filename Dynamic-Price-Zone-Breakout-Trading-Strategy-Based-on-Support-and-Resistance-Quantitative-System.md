#### Overview
This strategy is a quantitative trading system based on price range breakouts. It trades when the price breaks through these key levels by dynamically setting the upper and lower limits of the price range. The core idea of ​​the strategy is to capture trend opportunities when the market breaks through the established price range, and at the same time adapt to market changes by dynamically adjusting the price range. This strategy uses a flexible position management method that allows additional transactions in the same direction to maximize the benefits brought by the general trend.
#### Strategy Principle
The operation of the strategy is based on the following core mechanism: First, the corresponding step size (step_size) is set according to the characteristics of different trading varieties. This step size is based on about 1.5% of the price of the variety. The system will set a price range above and below the current price. When the price breaks through the upper limit, a long signal is triggered; when the price breaks through the lower limit, a short signal is triggered. After each breakout, the price range adjusts to adapt to the new market environment. The strategy supports adding positions in the same direction, and up to 200 positions in the same direction can be established, which allows the strategy to continue to make profits in a strong trend. Order processing adopts multiple guarantee mechanisms, including processing orders at the end of the K-line, recalculating after the transaction is completed, and calculating at each price change.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Strong dynamic adaptability: the price range will automatically adjust as the market changes, allowing the strategy to adapt to different market environments.
2. Outstanding trend tracking capabilities: By allowing positions to be added in the same direction, the strategy can fully grasp the strong trend.
3. Improved risk control: clear stop loss conditions are set, and positions are automatically closed when the price falls below the range.
4. Wide applicability: By setting corresponding step parameters for different trading varieties, the strategy can be applied to a variety of markets.
5. High calculation efficiency: Variable persistence and efficient calculation methods are adopted to ensure smooth operation of the strategy.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Risk of volatile market: In a volatile market, false breakthroughs may be frequently triggered, resulting in continuous stop losses.
2. Fund management risk: Adding positions in the same direction may lead to over-concentration of positions, and risk exposure in a single direction needs to be reasonably controlled.
3. Slippage risk: In times of severe fluctuations, you may face larger slippages, which will affect the performance of your strategy.
4. Parameter sensitivity: The rationality of the step size setting directly affects the strategy effect and needs to be fully tested.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introducing volatility indicators: The step size can be dynamically adjusted according to market volatility to improve strategy adaptability.
2. Add screening mechanism: add trend confirmation indicators to reduce losses caused by false breakthroughs.
3. Improve position management: Design a more detailed position control mechanism to balance returns and risks.
4. Optimize order execution: Intelligent order routing can be added to reduce the impact of slippage.
5. Add time dimension: consider the time characteristics of the market and adjust strategy parameters at different periods.
#### Summary
This is a well designed and logical trend following strategy. Through the setting and adjustment of dynamic price ranges, combined with flexible position management, the strategy can effectively capture market trend opportunities. While there is some room for optimization, overall the strategy provides a robust quantitative trading framework. Through continuous optimization and improvement, the performance of the strategy can be further improved. The design of the strategy fully considers various situations in actual transactions, including order processing, calculation efficiency and other key factors, showing strong practicality.

#### Overview
This strategy is a quantitative trading system based on price range breakouts. It operates by dynamically setting upper and lower price limits and executing trades when prices break through these key levels. The core concept is to capture trending opportunities when the market breaks out of established price ranges while adapting to market changes through dynamic adjustment of price zones. The strategy employs flexible position management, allowing additional trades in the same direction to maximize profits from major trends.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy operates based on the following core mechanisms: First, it sets appropriate step sizes for different trading instruments, typically around 1.5% of the instrument's price. The system establishes price zones above and below the current price, triggering long signals when prices break above the upper limit and short signals when breaking below the lower limit. After each breakout, the price zones adjust to adapt to the new market environment. The strategy supports adding positions in the same direction, allowing up to 200 positions, enabling profit maximization during strong trends. Order processing includes multiple safeguards, including processing at bar close, recalculating after trade execution, and computing at every price tick.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Strong Dynamic Adaptation: Price zones automatically adjust with market changes, allowing the strategy to adapt to different market conditions.
2. Excellent Trend Following Capability: Through allowing additional positions in the same direction, the strategy can fully capitalize on strong trends.
3. Comprehensive Risk Control: Clear stop-loss conditions are set, automatically closing positions when prices break below the zone.
4. Wide Applicability: The strategy can be applied to various markets through appropriate step size parameters for different trading instruments.
5. High Computational Efficiency: Employs variable persistence and efficient calculation methods to ensure smooth strategy operation.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Choppy Market Risk: Frequent false breakouts in range-bound markets may lead to consecutive stops.
2. Position Management Risk: Adding positions in the same direction may lead to over-concentration, requiring proper control of directional risk exposure.
3. Slippage Risk: Significant slippage during volatile periods may affect strategy performance.
4. Parameter Sensitivity: The effectiveness of the strategy directly depends on appropriate step size settings, requiring thorough testing.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Incorporate Volatility Indicators: Dynamically adjust step sizes based on market volatility to improve strategy adaptability.
2. Add Filtering Mechanisms: Include trend confirmation indicators to reduce losses from false breakouts.
3. Enhance Position Management: Design more detailed position control mechanisms to balance returns and risks.
4. Optimize Order Execution: Add smart order routing to reduce slippage impact.
5. Include Time Dimension: Consider market time characteristics to adjust strategy parameters during different periods.

#### Summary
This is a well-designed trend following strategy with clear logic. Through dynamic price zone settings and adjustments, combined with flexible position management, the strategy can effectively capture market trending opportunities. While there is room for optimization, overall, the strategy provides a robust quantitative trading framework. Through continuous optimization and improvement, strategy performance can be further enhanced. The strategy design thoroughly considers various aspects of practical trading, including order processing and computational efficiency, demonstrating strong practicality.[/trans]
