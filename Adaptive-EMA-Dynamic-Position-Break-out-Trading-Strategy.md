#### Overview
This strategy is an adaptive trading strategy based on a dual moving average system. It identifies buy signals through the intersection of the fast moving average (EMA25) and the slow moving average (EMA100), and combines dynamic stop loss and profit targets to optimize the trading effect. This strategy adopts breakthrough trading ideas, focuses on risk control while ensuring returns, and is suitable for medium and long-term trend trading.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy includes three key parts:
1. Signal system: Use EMA25 to cross EMA100 to form a long signal. This crossover usually heralds the beginning of an upward trend.
2. Risk control: Use the lowest point of the nearest red candle below EMA100 as the stop loss point. This setting can effectively prevent losses caused by false breakthroughs.
3. Profit management: Use a risk-to-benefit ratio of 1:3 to set a profit target. When the profit reaches 2%, the stop loss point will be automatically adjusted to the cost line to achieve risk-free positions.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. High signal reliability: Using slow EMA as trend confirmation can effectively filter out false signals.
2. Improved risk control: Dynamic stop loss setting and breakthrough confirmation mechanism reduce trading risks.
3. Stable return characteristics: By setting a reasonable risk-return ratio, the expected return of the strategy is improved.
4. High degree of automation: including complete signal generation, stop-profit and stop-loss and position management logic.
5. Strong adaptability: parameters can be adjusted according to different market conditions.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Risk of volatile market: Stop loss may be triggered frequently in a volatile market.
2. Slippage risk: You may face execution slippage during periods of high volatility.
3. Risk of false breakthrough: A false breakthrough may occur in the moving average crossover signal.
4. Parameter sensitivity: The moving average cycle setting has a greater impact on strategy performance.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce trading volume confirmation: Add trading volume indicators to the signal system to improve the reliability of breakthroughs.
2. Optimize the stop loss mechanism: Consider introducing ATR dynamic stop loss to make the stop loss more adaptable.
3. Add trend strength filtering: add trend strength indicators such as ADX to optimize entry timing.
4. Improve position management: dynamically adjust position size based on volatility.
5. Add market environment judgment: Introduce market region identification mechanism and adopt different parameter settings in different market environments.
#### Summary
This strategy captures the starting point of the trend through moving average crossover, and cooperates with dynamic stop loss and profit management mechanisms to achieve better risk-return characteristics. The strategic design fully considers actual combat needs and has strong practicability. Through the suggested optimization direction, the stability and adaptability of the strategy can be further improved. The strategy is suitable for traders with strong risk tolerance and the pursuit of mid- to long-term stable returns. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is an adaptive trading system based on a dual moving average system, which identifies buy signals through the crossover of fast moving average (EMA25) and slow moving average (EMA100), combined with dynamic stop-loss and profit targets to optimize trading performance. The strategy adopts a breakout trading approach, focusing on risk control while ensuring returns, suitable for medium to long-term trend trading.

#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy includes three key components:
1. Signal System: Using EMA25 crossing above EMA100 to generate long signals, which typically indicates the beginning of an uptrend.
2. Risk Control: Using the lowest point of the most recent red candle below EMA100 as the stop-loss point, effectively preventing losses from false breakouts.
3. Profit Management: Adopting a 1:3 risk-reward ratio for profit targets, and automatically adjusting the stop-loss to breakeven when reaching 2% profit, achieving risk-free position holding.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. High Signal Reliability: Using slow EMA for trend confirmation effectively filters false signals.
2. Comprehensive Risk Control: Dynamic stop-loss settings and breakout confirmation mechanism reduce trading risks.
3. Stable Return Characteristics: Reasonable risk-reward ratio setting improves strategy's expected returns.
4. High Automation Level: Includes complete signal generation, stop-loss/take-profit, and position management logic.
5. Strong Adaptability: Parameters can be adjusted according to different market conditions.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Oscillating Market Risk: May trigger frequent stop-losses in sideways markets.
2. Slippage Risk: May face execution slippage during high volatility periods.
3. False Breakout Risk: Moving average crossover signals may produce false breakouts.
4. Parameter Sensitivity: Moving average period settings significantly impact strategy performance.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Incorporate Volume Confirmation: Add volume indicators to the signal system to improve breakout reliability.
2. Optimize Stop-Loss Mechanism: Consider introducing ATR dynamic stop-loss for better adaptability.
3. Add Trend Strength Filtering: Include trend strength indicators like ADX to optimize entry timing.
4. Perfect Position Management: Dynamically adjust position size based on volatility.
5. Include Market Environment Assessment: Introduce market regime identification mechanism to adopt different parameter settings in different market environments.

#### Summary
The strategy captures trend initiation points through moving average crossovers, coupled with dynamic stop-loss and profit management mechanisms, achieving favorable risk-reward characteristics. The strategy design fully considers practical requirements and demonstrates strong practicality. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy's stability and adaptability can be further enhanced. It is suitable for traders with strong risk tolerance who pursue medium to long-term stable returns.[/trans]
