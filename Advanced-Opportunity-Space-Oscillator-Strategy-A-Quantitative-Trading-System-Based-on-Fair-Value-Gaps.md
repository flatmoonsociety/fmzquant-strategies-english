#### Overview
This strategy is an innovative trading system based on the Fair Value Gap (FVG), which captures potential trading opportunities by identifying price gaps and volume anomalies in the market. This strategy combines a dynamic counting mechanism and normalization processing, which can not only accurately identify buying and selling signals, but also help traders better understand the market structure through visual display.
#### Strategy Principle
The core of the strategy is to identify potential trading opportunities by monitoring price gaps between consecutive candlesticks. Specifically:
1. The condition for the formation of long FVG (BFVG) is that the lowest price of the current K line is higher than the highest price of the two previous K lines.
2. The condition for the formation of short FVG (SFVG) is that the highest price of the current K line is lower than the lowest price of the two previous K lines.
3. The strategy introduces a verification mechanism based on trading volume and gap size. Only FVG that meets the verification conditions will trigger trading signals.
4. Use a dynamic counting window of 50 periods to accumulate the number of long and short FVGs
5. Convert the gap width into a more intuitive indicator value through normalization processing
#### Strategic Advantages
1. The system has a complete signal verification mechanism, which improves signal quality through double confirmation of trading volume and gap width.
2. Dynamic counting window can effectively capture changes in market trends
3. Normalization processing makes signals in different periods comparable
4. The strategy has automatic position management function and will automatically close reverse positions before opening new positions.
5. Excellent visualization effect, making it easier for traders to understand the market status
#### Strategy Risk
1. FVG signals may produce false signals in highly volatile markets
2. Fixed verification parameters may not be suitable for all market environments
3. There is no stop-loss and take-profit mechanism, which may lead to larger retracements.
4. Frequent transactions may bring higher transaction costs
It is recommended to manage these risks by setting appropriate stop loss positions and introducing market environment filters.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce an adaptive parameter adjustment mechanism to enable the strategy to better adapt to different market environments
2. Add a trend filter and only do one-way transactions in strong trends
3. Design a more complex position management system, including batch opening of positions and dynamic stop loss
4. Consider transaction costs and optimize transaction frequency
5. Combine with other technical indicators to improve signal reliability
#### Summary
This is an innovative trading strategy based on price structure that captures market opportunities through intelligent identification and verification of fair value gaps. The design concept of the strategy is clear, the implementation method is professional, and it has good scalability. Through the suggested optimization direction, the stability and profitability of the strategy are expected to be further improved. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is an innovative trading system based on Fair Value Gaps (FVG), designed to capture potential trading opportunities by identifying price gaps and volume anomalies in the market. The strategy combines dynamic counting mechanisms and normalization processing, not only accurately identifying buy and sell signals but also helping traders better understand market structure through visualization.

#### Strategy Principles
The core of the strategy is to identify potential trading opportunities by monitoring price gaps between consecutive candles. Specifically:
1. Bullish FVG (BFVG) forms when the current candle's low is higher than the high of two candles ago
2. Bearish FVG (SFVG) forms when the current candle's high is lower than the low of two candles ago
3. The strategy incorporates a verification mechanism based on volume and gap size, where only FVGs meeting verification conditions trigger trading signals
4. Uses a 50-period dynamic counting window to accumulate the number of bullish and bearish FVGs
5. Through normalization processing, gap widths are transformed into more intuitive indicator values

#### Strategy Advantages
1. The system has a comprehensive signal verification mechanism, improving signal quality through dual confirmation of volume and gap magnitude
2. Dynamic counting window effectively captures market trend changes
3. Normalization processing makes signals comparable across different periods
4. Strategy includes automatic position management, closing reverse positions before opening new ones
5. Excellent visualization effects, making it easier for traders to understand market conditions

#### Strategy Risks
1. FVG signals may generate false signals in highly volatile markets
2. Fixed verification parameters may not be suitable for all market environments
3. Lack of stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms may lead to significant drawdowns
4. Frequent trading may result in high transaction costs
It is recommended to manage these risks by setting appropriate stop-loss levels and introducing market environment filters.

#### Optimization Directions
1. Introduce adaptive parameter adjustment mechanisms to better adapt to different market environments
2. Add trend filters to trade only in the direction of strong trends
3. Design more sophisticated position management systems, including staged position building and dynamic stop-loss
4. Consider transaction costs and optimize trading frequency
5. Combine with other technical indicators to improve signal reliability

#### Summary
This is an innovative trading strategy based on price structure, capturing market opportunities through intelligent identification and verification of fair value gaps. The strategy's design concept is clear, implementation is professional, and it has good scalability. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy's stability and profitability can be further enhanced.[/trans]

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 9) Simple Trading Logic (STRATEGY)
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - If "verifyb" is detected, go long.
// - If "verifys" is detected, go short.
//
// You can extend this with Stop Loss, Take Profit, 
// closing old positions, etc.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bool goLong  = verifyb
bool goShort = verifys

// Basic example: Open Long if verifyb, Open Short if verifys.
if goLong
    // First close any short position if it exists
    if strategy.position_size < 0
        strategy.close("Short FVG")
    // Then open Long
    strategy.entry("Long FVG", strategy.long)

if goShort
    // First close any long position if it exists
    if strategy.position_size > 0
        strategy.close("Long FVG")
    // Then open Short
    strategy.entry("Short FVG", strategy.short)
