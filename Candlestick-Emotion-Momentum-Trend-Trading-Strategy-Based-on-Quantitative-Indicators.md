#### Overview
This strategy analyzes market sentiment based on candlestick patterns and quantifies market psychology through three core oscillators (hesitation oscillator, fear oscillator, and greed oscillator). The strategy combines momentum and trend indicators, as well as volume confirmation, to build a complete trading system. This strategy is suitable for traders who wish to identify high-probability trading opportunities through market sentiment analysis.
#### Strategy Principle
The core of the strategy is to construct three sentiment oscillators by analyzing different candlestick patterns:
1. Hesitation Oscillator - Gauge market uncertainty through Doji and Gyro patterns
2. Fear Oscillator - Tracks Bearish Sentiment with Shooting Stars, Hanging Man and Bearish Engulfing Patterns
3. Greedy Oscillator - Detect Bullish Sentiment with Bars, Hammers, Bullish Engulfing and Three White Soldiers
The average of these three oscillators makes up the Candle Sentiment Index (CEI). When CEI breaks through different thresholds, long and short trading signals are triggered and confirmed by trading volume.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Systematic sentiment analysis - transform subjective analysis into objective indicators through quantitative candlestick patterns
2. Improved risk management - including mechanisms such as maximum position period, stop-profit and stop-loss, and cooling-off period
3. Flexible recovery mechanism - when a transaction suffers a loss, the strategy will try to recover by breaking through the equilibrium point
4. Multi-market applicability - can be applied to multiple markets such as stocks, foreign exchange and cryptocurrencies
5. High signal reliability - improve accuracy through volume confirmation and multiple technical indicator verifications
#### Strategy Risk
1. Parameter sensitivity - the settings of various thresholds need to be fully tested and optimized
2. Market environment dependence - false signals may be generated in volatile markets
3. Slippage risk - possible execution risk in illiquid markets
4. Risk of over-trading - a cooling-off period needs to be set appropriately to avoid frequent trading
5. Systemic risk - the potential for greater losses in major market events
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Dynamic thresholds - automatically adjust various thresholds based on market volatility
2. Classification of market status - identification mechanism for increasing trends and volatile markets
3. Machine learning optimization - Use machine learning algorithms to optimize parameter combinations
4. Enhanced risk management - adding fund management and position control modules
5. Signal filtering - integrate more technical indicators to filter out false signals
#### Summary
This is an innovative strategy that combines technical analysis with quantitative trading. Through systematic sentiment analysis and strict risk management, this strategy can provide traders with reliable trading signals. Although there is some room for optimization, the basic framework of the strategy is robust and suitable for further development and real-time application.

#### Overview
This strategy analyzes market sentiment through candlestick patterns using three core oscillators (Indecision, Fear, and Greed) to quantify market psychology. It combines momentum and trend indicators with volume confirmation to build a complete trading system. The strategy is suitable for traders who want to identify high-probability trading opportunities through market sentiment analysis.

#### Strategy Principles
The core of the strategy is built on three sentiment oscillators derived from candlestick patterns:
1. Indecision Oscillator - Measures market uncertainty through Doji and Spinning Top patterns
2. Fear Oscillator - Tracks bearish sentiment through Shooting Star, Hanging Man, and Bearish Engulfing patterns
3. Greed Oscillator - Detects bullish sentiment through Marubozu, Hammer, Bullish Engulfing, and Three White Soldiers

The average of these three oscillators forms the Candle Emotion Index (CEI). Trading signals are triggered when CEI breaks different thresholds, confirmed by volume analysis.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Systematic Sentiment Analysis - Transforms subjective candlestick analysis into objective indicators
2. Comprehensive Risk Management - Includes maximum holding period, profit/loss limits, and cooldown periods
3. Flexible Recovery Mechanism - Attempts to recover through breakeven points when trades move against position
4. Multi-Market Compatibility - Applicable across stocks, forex, and cryptocurrency markets
5. High Signal Reliability - Uses volume confirmation and multiple technical indicators for validation

#### Strategy Risks
1. Parameter Sensitivity - Various thresholds require thorough testing and optimization
2. Market Environment Dependency - May generate false signals in ranging markets
3. Slippage Risk - Execution risks in markets with poor liquidity
4. Overtrading Risk - Requires proper cooldown periods to avoid excessive trading
5. Systematic Risk - May suffer significant losses during major market events

#### Optimization Directions
1. Dynamic Thresholds - Automatically adjust thresholds based on market volatility
2. Market State Classification - Add trend and range market identification mechanisms
3. Machine Learning Optimization - Use machine learning algorithms to optimize parameter combinations
4. Enhanced Risk Management - Add money management and position sizing modules
5. Signal Filtering - Integrate more technical indicators to filter false signals

#### Summary
This innovative strategy combines technical analysis with quantitative trading. Through systematic sentiment analysis and strict risk management, it provides reliable trading signals for traders. While there is room for optimization, the basic framework is robust and suitable for further development and live trading implementation.[/trans]
