## Overview
The multiple-screening Bollinger Bands trading strategy is a quantitative trading strategy that combines Bollinger Bands indicators, moving average indicators, RSI indicators and K-line graphic characteristics to perform multiple condition screenings and issue trading signals when the conditions are met. This is a typical trend following strategy that makes profits by capturing medium and long-term price trend fluctuations.
## Strategy Principle
### Indicator calculation
This strategy mainly uses three indicators: Bollinger Bands, moving averages and RSI. Among them, the middle rail of the Bollinger Bands is the n-day simple moving average of the price, and the upper rail and the lower rail are respectively the middle rail + 2 times the standard deviation and the middle rail - 2 times the standard deviation. The RSI indicator is a value between 0 and 100 calculated based on the rise and fall within a certain period.
### Trading Signals
This strategy generates trading signals based on the following three main conditions:
(1) The Bollinger Bands break through the lower track & the K-line entity refutes. When the closing price crosses the lower rail and the color of the K-line entity is opposite to the current trend direction, go long.
(2) The Bollinger Band upper limit breaks through and the K-line entity refutes. When the closing price falls below the upper limit and the color of the K-line entity is opposite to the current trend direction, go short.
(3) K-line entity turns. If the direction of the position is consistent with the color of the K-line entity, the position will be closed.
In addition, this strategy also sets up auxiliary conditions such as moving average filters, K-line entity filters, and RSI filters to strictly control entry.
## Advantage Analysis
- Strict control of multiple conditions can reduce the risk of false breakthroughs
- Adopt trend following method to reduce the frequency of transactions
- RSI indicator assists judgment to avoid reversal traps
## Risk Analysis
- Improper Bollinger Band parameter settings may result in fewer signals
- Failure to break through may result in larger losses
- The trading frequency is low and some trading opportunities may be missed.
Risks can be reduced by adjusting Bollinger Band parameters and strictly controlling stop loss.
## Optimization direction
- You can test the strategy performance under different parameters and find the optimal parameters
- Machine learning algorithms can be added to allow the strategy to automatically optimize parameters
- More factors and filters can be added to improve strategy stability
## Summarize
Overall, this strategy is a typical mid- to long-term trend following strategy. By screening multiple conditions, strictly controlling the timing of entry and exit, and adopting trend trading methods, unnecessary transactions can be reduced and the medium and long-term market trends can be captured. There is still a lot of room for optimization of this strategy. By adjusting parameters and adding more auxiliary tools, the stability and profitability of the strategy can be further improved.

## Overview

The Multi-filter Bollinger Band Trading Strategy is a quantitative trading strategy that combines the Bollinger Band indicator, moving average indicator, RSI indicator and K-line graphical features for multi-conditional screening to generate trading signals when conditions are met. It is a typical trend-following strategy that profits by capturing mid-to-long term price trend fluctuations.

## Strategy Principle

### Indicator Calculation

The strategy mainly uses three indicators: Bollinger Bands, moving average and RSI. Among them, the middle rail of Bollinger Bands is the n-day simple moving average of price, and the upper and lower rails are the middle rails +2 standard deviations and the middle rails -2 standard deviations respectively. The RSI indicator is a value between 0 and 100 calculated based on the rise/fall range over a certain period of time.

### Trading Signals  

The strategy generates trading signals through the following three main conditions:

(1) Bollinger lower-band breakout & K-line body contradiction. When the closing price breaks through the lower band upwards and the color of the K-line body contradicts the current trend direction, go long.

(2) Bollinger upper-band breakout & K-line body contradiction. When the closing price breaks through the upper band downwards and the color of the K-line body contradicts the current trend direction, go short.

(3) K-line body reversal. If the position direction is consistent with the K-line body color reversal, close the position.

In addition, the strategy also sets moving average filters, K-line body filters, RSI filters and other auxiliary conditions to strictly control entry.

## Advantage Analysis   

- Multiple strict conditions control can reduce the risk of false breakouts
- Trend tracking method reduces trading frequency  
- RSI indicator assists in avoiding reversal traps

## Risk Analysis

- Improper Bollinger parameter settings may result in few signals  
- Failed breakouts can cause greater losses
- Lower trading frequency may miss some trading opportunities  

Risks can be reduced by adjusting Bollinger parameters and strictly controlling stops.

## Optimization Directions

- Test strategy performance under different parameters to find optimal parameters
- Add machine learning algorithms to automatically optimize parameters  
- Add more factors and filters to improve strategy stability

## Summary  

Overall, this strategy is a typical mid-to-long term trend following strategy. By multi-conditional screening and strictly controlling entry and exit timing with a trend trading approach, it can reduce unnecessary trading and capture mid-to-long term market trends. There is still great room for optimizing this strategy by adjusting parameters, adding more auxiliary tools and so on, to further enhance the stability and profitability of the strategy.
