 [trans]

This strategy calculates three moving averages of different periods and combines price breakthroughs to form trading signals. It is a typical trend following strategy. This strategy is designed to track the mid-term market trend and can be applied to different varieties and trading environments by dynamically adjusting parameters.
#### Principle
This strategy contains three moving averages: MA1, MA2 and MA3. A trading channel is formed between MA1 and MA2, and its intersection gives trading signals; MA3 is used to filter signals.
When the fast average MA1 crosses the mid-term average MA2, it indicates that the short-term trend is getting stronger. At this time, if the price is higher than the long-term average MA3, a long signal is generated; conversely, if MA1 crosses below the MA2 and the price is lower than MA3, a short signal is generated.
The function of MA3 is to filter out short-term market noise and only generate signals after it is determined that the trend has entered the mid- to long-term stage. This strategy can find the best parameter combination in different markets by dynamically adjusting the parameters of three moving averages.
#### Advantages
- Capture different period trends through multiple sets of moving averages
- MA3 filters signals to avoid arbitrage
- Customizable average line type and parameters, strong adaptability
- Visualize intersections to identify signal points
#### Risk
- When the trend of a large period is reversed, the moving average crosses lagging behind
- Transaction frequency may be too high, increasing transaction costs and slippage risk
- Improper parameters can lead to over-trading or signal lags
You can select different varieties by adjusting the MA cycle and optimizing parameters; optimize the stop loss strategy to control single losses; and combine other technical indicators to confirm the validity of the signal and reduce the probability of false signals.
#### Optimization direction
- Add other indicators to judge trends, such as MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- Add stop loss/take profit strategy
- Dynamically adjust parameters and find the optimal parameter combination
- Optimization of parameters for different varieties
- Consider transaction costs and optimize transaction frequency
#### Summarize
This strategy generates trading signals by calculating three moving averages and observing the intersections, and uses the idea of ​​​​fast, medium and slow to determine the trend. It is a typical trend following strategy. This strategy can be applied to different varieties through parameter optimization, but there is a risk of being trapped and missing the turning point. In the future, other technical indicators can be introduced to judge the effectiveness of the signal and a dynamic parameter optimization mechanism can be developed for optimization to make the strategy more flexible.

This strategy generates trading signals by calculating three moving averages of different periods and combining price breakthroughs. It belongs to a typical trend-following strategy. The strategy aims to follow medium-term trends in the market and can be adapted to different products and trading environments by dynamically adjusting parameters.  

#### Principle 

The strategy contains three moving averages: MA1, MA2 and MA3. MA1 and MA2 form a trading channel, and their crossover generates trading signals; MA3 is used to filter signals.

When the fast moving average MA1 crosses above the medium-term moving average MA2, it indicates the strengthening of the short-term trend. At this time, if the price is above the long-term moving average MA3, a long signal is generated; conversely, if MA1 crosses below MA2 and the price is below MA3, a short signal is generated.

The role of MA3 is to filter out short-term market noise and only generate signals after determining that the trend has entered the medium and long term stage. By dynamically adjusting the parameters of the three moving averages, the strategy can find the optimal parameter combination in different markets.

#### Advantages

- Capture trends of different cycles through multiple moving averages  
- MA3 filters signals to avoid whipsaws
- Customizable moving average types and parameters, high adaptability
- Visualize crosses to identify signal points

#### Risks

- Moving averages may lag when major trend reverses 
- Potentially high trading frequency, increasing trading costs and slippage risks
- Improper parameters may cause overtrading or lagging signals

Can optimize MA periods for different products; optimize stop loss to control single loss; combine other technical indicators to confirm signal validity and reduce false signals.

#### Optimization Directions

- Add other indicators to determine trends, e.g. MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- Add stop loss/take profit strategies
- Dynamically adjust parameters to find optimal combinations
- Parameter optimization for different products  
- Consider trading costs, optimize trade frequency

#### Summary

This strategy generates trading signals by calculating three moving averages and observing their crosses. Using the idea of combining fast, medium and slow lines to determine trends, it is a typical trend-following strategy. The strategy can be adapted to different products through parameter optimization, but risks whipsaws and missing turnings. Future improvements could introduce other technical indicators to judge signal validity, develop dynamic parameter optimization mechanisms, etc. to make the strategy more flexible.
