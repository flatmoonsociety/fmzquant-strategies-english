[trans]
This strategy is a quantitative trading system based on the RSI dynamic oscillator. By performing polynomial fitting and time series analysis on the RSI indicator, the rate of change of RSI is calculated to capture market momentum. The strategy uses advanced mathematical methods such as QR decomposition for signal processing, and combines it with the moving average system for trading decisions.
#### Strategy Principle
The core of the strategy is the Delta-RSI oscillator, which is implemented through the following steps:
1. First calculate the traditional RSI indicator as basic data
2. Use polynomial fitting to smooth the RSI and reduce noise.
3. Calculate the time derivative of RSI to obtain Delta-RSI, which reflects the rate of change of RSI.
4. Generate trading signals by comparing Delta-RSI with its moving average
5. Use root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate and filter the quality of the fit
Trading signals can be generated in three ways:
- Zero Line Crossing: Go long when Delta-RSI turns from negative to positive, go short when it turns from positive to negative
- Signal line crossover: Go long/short when Delta-RSI crosses above/below its moving average, respectively
- Change of Direction: Delta-RSI goes long when the negative zone starts to rise and short when the positive zone starts to fall
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Solid mathematical foundation: using advanced mathematical methods such as QR decomposition for signal processing, the theoretical foundation is reliable
2. Signal smoothing: Polynomial fitting can effectively filter market noise and improve signal quality.
3. Strong flexibility: Provides a variety of signal generation methods and parameter selections to adapt to different market environments
4. Risk controllable: including RMSE filtering mechanism, which can filter out signals with higher reliability
5. Efficient calculation: Matrix operations adopt optimization algorithms and have high operating efficiency.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Parameter sensitivity: multiple key parameters need to be carefully adjusted. Improper parameter selection will seriously affect the performance of the strategy.
2. Hysteresis: signal smoothing will cause a certain lag, and rapid market trends may be missed.
3. False breakthroughs: False signals may be generated in volatile markets, increasing transaction costs.
4. Complex calculation: involves a lot of matrix operations and may have performance bottlenecks in high-frequency trading
5. Overfitting: When optimizing parameters, care must be taken to avoid overfitting historical data.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Adaptive parameters: The RSI cycle and fitting order can be dynamically adjusted according to market volatility
2. Multiple time periods: Combine signals from more time periods for cross-validation
3. Volatility filtering: Add volatility indicators such as ATR for signal filtering
4. Market classification: use different signal generation rules for different market states (trends/shocks)
5. Stop loss optimization: Add a more intelligent stop loss mechanism, such as dynamic stop loss based on support and resistance levels
#### Summary
This is a quantitative trading strategy with a complete structure and solid theoretical foundation. By analyzing the dynamic characteristics of RSI and combining it with modern mathematical methods for signal processing, we can better capture market trends. Although there are certain parameter sensitivity and computational complexity issues, this strategy has good application value through reasonable parameter selection and optimization improvement. It is recommended to pay attention to risk control when applying real offers, set positions reasonably, and continuously monitor strategy performance. ||

- Signal line crossing: Long/short when Delta-RSI crosses above/below its moving average
- Direction change: Long when Delta-RSI starts rising in negative territory, short when starts falling in positive territory

#### Strategy Advantages

2. Signal smoothing: Polynomial fitting can effectively filter market noise and improve signal quality
3. High flexibility: Provides multiple signal generation methods and parameter choices to adapt to different market conditions
4. Controllable risk: Includes RMSE filtering mechanism to screen out more reliable signals
5. Computational efficiency: Matrix operations use optimized algorithms for high running efficiency

#### Strategy Risks
1. Parameter sensitivity: Multiple key parameters need careful adjustment, poor parameter selection seriously affects strategy performance
2. Lag: Signal smoothing introduces some delay, may miss rapid market moves
3. False breakouts: May generate false signals in oscillating markets, increasing trading costs
4. Computational complexity: Involves many matrix operations, may have performance bottlenecks in high-frequency trading
5. Overfitting: Need to avoid overfitting historical data when optimizing parameters

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Adaptive parameters: Dynamically adjust RSI period and fitting order based on market volatility
2. Multiple timeframes: Incorporate signals from more timeframes for cross-validation
3. Volatility filtering: Add volatility indicators like ATR for signal filtering
4. Market classification: Use different signal generation rules for different market states (trend/oscillation)
5. Stop-loss optimization: Add smarter stop-loss mechanisms, like dynamic stops based on support/resistance levels

#### Summary
This is a complete quantitative trading strategy with solid theoretical foundation. Through analysis of RSI's dynamic characteristics combined with modern mathematical methods for signal processing, it can effectively capture market trends. While there are some issues with parameter sensitivity and computational complexity, the strategy has good practical value through proper parameter selection and optimization improvements. When applying to live trading, it's recommended to pay attention to risk control, set reasonable position sizes, and continuously monitor strategy performance.[/trans]

// Delta-RSI Oscillator Strategy
//
// A strategy that uses Delta-RSI Oscillator (© tbiktag) as a stand-alone indicator:
// https://www.tradingview.com/script/OXQVFTQD-Delta-RSI-Oscillator/
//
// Delta-RSI is a smoothed time derivative of the RSI, plotted as a histogram 
// and serving as a momentum indicator. 
// 
// Input parameters:
// RSI Length: The timeframe of the RSI that serves as an input to D-RSI.
// Length: The length of the lookback frame used for local regression.
// Polynomial Order: The order of the local polynomial function used to interpolate the RSI.
// Signal Length: The length of a EMA of the D-RSI series that is used as a signal line.
// Trade signals are generated based on three optional conditions:
// - Zero-crossing: bullish when D-RSI crosses zero from negative to positive values (bearish otherwise)
// - Signal Line Crossing: bullish when D-RSI crosses from below to above the signal line (bearish otherwise)
// - Direction Change: bullish when D-RSI was negative and starts ascending (bearish otherwise)
//
// Since D-RSI oscillator is based on polynomial fitting of the RSI curve, there is also an option
// to filter trade signal by means of the root mean-square error of the fit (normalized by the sample average).
//
