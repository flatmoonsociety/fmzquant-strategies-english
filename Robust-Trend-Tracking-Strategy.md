## Overview
The main idea of this strategy is to combine the 123 reversal pattern and the Smart Money Flow Index (SMI) indicator to achieve stable trend following trading. When two signals send out buy or sell signals at the same time, the strategy will establish the corresponding long or short position.
## Strategy Principle
The strategy consists of two parts:
1. 123 reversal strategy: This strategy implements reversal trading based on the closing price of the stock and the 9-day Stoch indicator. Specifically, when the closing price relationship of two consecutive days is reversed (that is, the closing price of the previous day is higher than the previous two days, and the closing price of the next day is lower than the previous day), and Stoch's fast line is higher than the slow line, go short; when the closing price relationship of two consecutive days is reversed (that is, the closing price of the previous day is lower than the previous two days, and the closing price of the next day is higher than the previous day), and Stoch's fast line is lower than the slow line, go long.
2. SMI strategy: This strategy implements trend tracking based on the intelligent fund flow index. The SMI indicator can reflect the game between institutional funds and retail funds. An increase in SMI indicates that institutional funds are absorbing, and conversely, an increase in SMI indicates that institutional funds are selling. Go long when the SMI indicator rises and go short when it falls.
When the 123 reversal pattern and the SMI index send out buy signals at the same time, this strategy will take a long position; when both send out sell signals at the same time, this strategy will take a short position.
## Strategic Advantages
This strategy combines reversal patterns and trend following indicators to effectively identify market reversal points and track trends to achieve stable profits. The specific advantages are as follows:
1. The 123 reversal pattern has a high winning rate and profitability, and can effectively identify short-term reversal opportunities.
2. The SMI indicator can reflect the flow of institutional funds, and tracking institutional funds can lead to more stable profits.
3. Combining reversal patterns and trend following indicators can improve the quality of signals, reduce unnecessary transactions, and effectively control risks.
## Strategy Risk
This strategy also has certain risks, mainly focusing on the following aspects:
1. There is a certain risk of false signals in the 123 reversal pattern, and loss-making transactions cannot be completely avoided. Parameters can be optimized appropriately to improve signal quality.
2. The SMI indicator has a certain lag and cannot fully reflect the flow of funds in real time. It can be combined with other indicators for verification to improve accuracy.
3. Dual signals bring about the problem of being too conservative and may miss the stronger unilateral trend market. The signal conditions can be appropriately relaxed and the filtering standards can be lowered.
## Optimization direction
This strategy can also be further optimized from the following aspects:
1. Optimize parameters, find the optimal parameter combination, and improve strategy profitability.
2. Adding a stop-loss mechanism can effectively control single losses.
3. Combine with other indicators or forms to further verify signal quality and improve signal accuracy.
4. Optimize parameters for different varieties to improve strategy adaptability.
## Summary
The overall idea of this strategy is clear, and it effectively combines reversal patterns and trend tracking indicators, which can stably identify short-term reversal opportunities and track mid- and long-term trends. Through parameter optimization and improvement of mechanism design, the profitability and risk control capabilities of the strategy can be further enhanced.

## Overview
The main idea of this strategy is to combine the 123 reversal pattern and the Smart Money Index (SMI) indicator to achieve stable trend tracking trading. The strategy will only establish corresponding long or short positions when both signals issue buy or sell signals at the same time.

## Strategy Principle  
The strategy consists of two parts:

1. 123 reversal strategy: This strategy implements reversal trading based on the closing price of the stock and the 9-day Stoch indicator. Specifically, go short when the closing price relationship reverses for two consecutive days (i.e. the previous closing price is higher than the one before the previous day, and the next closing price is lower than the previous day), and Stoch fast line is above slow line; go long when the closing price relationship reverses for two consecutive days (i.e. the previous closing price is lower than the one before the previous day, and the next closing price is higher than the previous day), and Stoch fast line is below slow line.

2. SMI strategy: This strategy implements trend tracking based on the Smart Money Index. The SMI indicator can reflect the game between institutional funds and retail funds. The rise of SMI indicates that institutional funds are absorbing funds, while the fall indicates that institutional funds are selling out. Go long when SMI rises and go short when SMI falls.  

The strategy will only take a long position when both the 123 reversal pattern and the SMI indicator issue a buy signal at the same time. It will only take a short position when both issue a sell signal at the same time.

## Strategy Advantages
The strategy combines reversal patterns and trend tracking indicators to effectively identify market reversal points and track trends for steady profits. The specific advantages are as follows:  

1. The 123 reversal pattern has a relatively high win rate and profit rate, which can effectively identify short-term reversal opportunities.

2. The SMI indicator can reflect the direction of institutional funds. Tracking institutional funds can obtain more steady profits. 

3. The combined use of reversal patterns and trend tracking indicators can improve the quality of signals, reduce unnecessary trading, and effectively control risks.


## Strategy Risks
The strategy also has some risks, mainly concentrated in the following areas:

1. The 123 reversal pattern has a certain risk of false signals and cannot completely avoid losing trades. Parameters can be optimized appropriately to improve signal quality.

2. The SMI indicator has a certain lag and cannot completely reflect the direction of funds in real time. Other indicators can be combined for verification to improve accuracy.

3. Double signals can lead to over-conservative problems, possibly missing stronger one-sided trending opportunities. Signal conditions can be appropriately relaxed to reduce filtering criteria.

## Optimization Directions
The strategy can also be further optimized in the following aspects:

1. Optimize parameters to find the optimal parameter combination and improve the profitability of the strategy.  

2. Add stop loss mechanisms to effectively control single loss.

3. Combine other indicators or patterns to further verify signal quality and improve signal accuracy.

4. Optimize parameters separately for different varieties to improve the adaptability of the strategy.


## Summary 
The overall idea of the strategy is clear, effectively combining reversal patterns and trend tracking indicators to steadily identify short-term reversal opportunities and track medium-to-long term trends. By improving parameters optimization and mechanism design, the profitability and risk control capabilities of the strategy can be further enhanced.

// This is combo strategies for get a cumulative signal. 
//
// First strategy
// This System was created from the Book "How I Tripled My Money In The 
// Futures Market" by Ulf Jensen, Page 183. This is reverse type of strategies.
// The strategy buys at market, if close price is higher than the previous close 
// during 2 days and the meaning of 9-days Stochastic Slow Oscillator is lower than 50. 
// The strategy sells at market, if close price is lower than the previous close price 
// during 2 days and the meaning of 9-days Stochastic Fast Oscillator is higher than 50.
//
// Second strategy
// Smart money index (SMI) or smart money flow index is a technical analysis indicator demonstrating investors sentiment. 
// The index was invented and popularized by money manager Don Hays.[1] The indicator is based on intra-day price patterns.
// The main idea is that the majority of traders (emotional, news-driven) overreact at the beginning of the trading day 
// because of the overnight news and economic data. There is also a lot of buying on market orders and short covering at the opening. 
// Smart, experienced investors start trading closer to the end of the day having the opportunity to evaluate market performance.
// Therefore, the basic strategy is to bet against the morning price trend and bet with the evening price trend. The SMI may be calculated 
// for many markets and market indices (S&P 500, DJIA, etc.)
//
// The SMI sends no clear signal whether the market is bullish or bearish. There are also no fixed absolute or relative readings signaling 
// about the trend. Traders need to look at the SMI dynamics relative to that of the market. If, for example, SMI rises sharply when the 
// market falls, this fact would mean that smart money is buying, and the market is to revert to an uptrend soon. The opposite situation 
// is also true. A rapidly falling SMI during a bullish market means that smart money is selling and that market is to revert to a downtrend 
// soon. The SMI is, therefore, a trend-based indicator.
// Some analysts use the smart money index to claim that precious metals such as gold will continually maintain value in the future.
