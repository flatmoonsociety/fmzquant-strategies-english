## Overview
This strategy is based on LazyBear's compressed momentum indicator, combined with Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels, to identify the compression and expansion patterns formed by price breakthrough channels, determine the potential trend direction of the stock price, and use trend following methods to determine the direction of opening a position. The advantage of the strategy is that it makes full use of the ability of the momentum indicator to identify potential trends, and sets up multiple conditional filters to control the quality of trading signals, which can effectively filter out uncertain trading signals and avoid too frequent trading during shock consolidation.
## Strategy Principle
1. Calculate the middle track, upper track and lower track in Bollinger Bands. The middle rail is a simple moving average of n-day closing prices, and the upper and lower rails are the standard deviation of n-day closing prices plus or minus m times the middle rail.
2. Calculate the midline, upper line and lower line in the Keltner channel. The middle line is a simple moving average of n-day closing prices, and the upper and lower lines are a simple moving average of n-day real volatility plus or minus m times the middle line.
3. Determine whether the price breaks through the upper and lower rails of the Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel to form compression and expansion patterns. When the price breaks through the lower band from above, it is a compression form, and when the price breaks through the upper band from below, it is an expansion form.
4. Calculate the value of the linear regression curve as a momentum indicator. When the momentum line crosses 0, it is a buy signal, and when it crosses below 0, it is a sell signal.
5. Combine compression and expansion patterns, momentum indicator direction, mean filter and other multiple conditions to determine the final trading signal. Only when all conditions are met will a trading signal be generated to avoid erroneous transactions.
## Strategic Advantages
1. Use dual filtering of Bollinger Bands and Keltner channels to identify high-quality compression and expansion patterns.
2. Momentum indicators can capture price trend reversals in a timely manner and complement the channel indicators.
3. Allow early entry to increase profit opportunities.
4. Use multiple conditions to judge and avoid frequent opening of positions in volatile market conditions.
5. Each technical index parameter can be customized to adapt to different varieties and parameter combinations.
6. The backtest time period can be set to optimize testing for a specific time period.
## Strategy Risk
1. Trend following strategies are prone to losses when the trend reverses.
2. Improper parameter settings may lead to excessive trading frequency or poor signal quality.
3. Relying on historical data testing, there is no guarantee that returns will continue to be stable in the future.
4. Unable to cope with market shocks and violent price fluctuations caused by emergencies.
5. Improper setting of the backtest time window may lead to overfitting.
## Strategy optimization direction
1. Optimize the parameters of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel to find the best combination.
2. Test adding trailing stop loss to control the maximum loss in a single transaction.
3. Try to further optimize under specific varieties and cycle parameter combinations.
4. Explore adding machine learning models to determine trend reversal.
5. Test different entry sequences and position management strategies.
6. Study how to identify trend reversal signals and stop losses promptly.
## Summarize
This strategy integrates a variety of technical indicators to determine the price trend direction and conduct trend tracking, and has strong adaptability. Through parameter customization and multiple condition filtering, trading frequency can be effectively controlled and signal quality improved. However, we still need to be vigilant about reversal trading and emergencies, and we can continue to explore trend reversal signals and risk control mechanisms to optimize them to make the strategy more robust.

## Overview

This strategy is based on LazyBear's Squeeze Momentum indicator, combining Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify price breakouts from channel compression and expansion to determine potential trend direction of prices, and adopts a trend following approach to decide entry direction. The advantage of this strategy is making full use of momentum indicator's ability to identify potential trends, and setting multiple condition filters to control signal quality which can effectively filter out uncertain signals and avoid over-trading during ranging markets.

## Strategy Logic

1. Calculate middle band, upper band and lower band of Bollinger Bands. Middle band is n-day simple moving average of close price, upper and lower bands are middle band plus/minus m times n-day standard deviation of close price.

2. Calculate middle line, upper line and lower line of Keltner Channels. Middle line is n-day simple moving average of close price, upper and lower lines are middle line plus/minus m times n-day simple moving average of true range.  

3. Determine if price breaks through upper or lower band of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to form compression and expansion patterns. Compression forms when price breaks down through lower band, while expansion forms when price breaks up through upper band.

4. Calculate value of Linear Regression curve as momentum indicator. Upcrossing 0 is buy signal while downcrossing 0 is sell signal.

5. Combine compression/expansion patterns, momentum direction, mean filtering and other conditions to determine final trading signals. Signals are only triggered when all conditions are met to avoid bad trades.

## Advantages of the Strategy

1. Using double filtration of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify quality compression and expansion patterns.

2. Momentum indicator can timely capture price trend reversals, complementing channel indicators.

3. Allow early entry to increase profit opportunities. 

4. Adopt multiple condition judgment to avoid over-trading during ranging markets.
5. Technical indicator parameters are customizable, adapting to different products and parameter combinations.

6. Backtest time frame can be set to optimize over specific periods.

## Risks of the Strategy

1. Trend following strategies are prone to losses when trend reverses.

2. Improper parameter settings may lead to over-trading or poor signal quality.

3. Reliance on historical data cannot guarantee stable future returns. 

4. Unable to handle market turbulence and drastic price swings caused by black swan events.

5. Improper backtest time window settings may lead to overfitting.

## Optimization Directions

1. Optimize parameters of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to find best combination.

2. Test adding trailing stop loss to control maximum loss per trade.

3. Attempt further optimizations for specific products and period/parameter combinations.  

4. Explore integrating machine learning models to determine trend reversals.
5. Test different entry sequencing and position sizing strategies.

6. Research how to identify trend reversal signals and exit in time.

## Summary

This strategy integrates multiple technical indicators to judge price trend direction and follow the trend, having relatively strong adaptability. By customizing parameters and using multiple condition filters, it can effectively control trading frequency and improve signal quality. But reversal trades and black swan events should still be watched out for. Further exploring trend reversal signals and risk control mechanisms can be done to make the strategy more robust.
