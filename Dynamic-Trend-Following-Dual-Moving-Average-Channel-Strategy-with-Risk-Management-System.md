#### Overview
This strategy is a dynamic trend following system based on dual moving average channels, combined with a risk management mechanism. This strategy uses two simple moving averages (SMA) to construct a trading channel, with the upper track using the moving average calculated at the highest price and the lower track using the moving average calculated at the lowest price. The system uses the closing price of five consecutive K lines to break through the upper rail as an entry signal, and the closing price of five consecutive K lines to fall below the lower rail or retrace 25% from the highest point as an exit signal to achieve dynamic tracking of trends and risk control.
#### Strategy Principle
The core principle of the strategy is to capture the price trend through the double moving average channel and establish a strict entry and exit mechanism:
1. Entry mechanism: The price is required to remain above the upper track for five consecutive days to ensure the continuity and effectiveness of the trend.
2. Appearance mechanism: divided into two levels
   - Trend divergence exit: When the price falls below the lower band for five consecutive days, it indicates that the trend may be reversed.
   - Stop loss exit: Stop loss is triggered when the price retraces 25% from the highest point to prevent excessive losses
3. Position management: Use a fixed proportion of the total account value to open positions to achieve effective allocation of funds.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Stability of trend following: Filter out false breakthrough signals by requiring five consecutive days of breakthrough confirmation
2. Completeness of risk control: Combined with trend divergence and stop-loss mechanism to build double protection
3. Flexible and adjustable parameters: the moving average period and stop loss ratio can be optimized according to different market characteristics
4. Clear execution logic: clear entry and exit conditions, reducing interference caused by subjective judgments
5. Scientific fund management: Use account proportional positions instead of fixed lots to better control risks
#### Strategy Risk
1. Volatile market risk: A volatile market can easily generate false signals, leading to frequent trading.
2. Slippage risk: In fast market conditions, the stop-loss execution price may deviate greatly from expectations.
3. Parameter dependence: There may be large differences in optimal parameters under different market environments.
4. Trend delay: Due to the use of moving averages, there is a certain lag at the turning point of the trend.
5. Fund efficiency: The holding conditions are relatively strict and some profit opportunities may be missed.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Dynamic parameter optimization: develop an adaptive parameter system to automatically adjust the moving average period according to market volatility
2. Market environment filtering: increase the trend strength indicator and automatically reduce the trading frequency in volatile markets
3. Multi-time period confirmation: Add a longer period trend confirmation mechanism to improve signal reliability
4. Stop loss optimization: Introduce a dynamic stop loss mechanism and automatically adjust the stop loss ratio based on volatility
5. Position management optimization: dynamically adjust the position opening ratio based on volatility and profit-loss ratio
#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete trend tracking trading system through dual moving average channels, combined with strict entry confirmation and dual exit mechanisms, to achieve effective tracking of trends and effective risk control. The advantage of the strategy lies in clear execution logic and perfect risk control, but it still needs to optimize parameters for different market environments, and can be further improved by adding market environment filtering and multi-time period confirmation. Overall, this is a quantitative trading strategy with complete structure and strict logic, suitable for application in market environments with obvious trends.

#### Overview
This strategy is a dynamic trend following system based on dual moving average channels, combined with risk management mechanisms. It utilizes two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) to construct a trading channel, with the upper band calculated using the high price and the lower band using the low price. The system generates entry signals when the closing price remains above the upper band for five consecutive bars, and exit signals when either the price falls below the lower band for five consecutive bars or retraces 25% from the highest point, achieving dynamic trend tracking and risk control.

#### Strategy Principles
The core principles involve capturing price trends through dual moving average channels and establishing strict entry and exit mechanisms:
1. Entry Mechanism: Requires price to maintain above the upper band for five consecutive days, ensuring trend continuity and validity
2. Exit Mechanism: Operates on two levels
   - Trend Deviation Exit: Triggered when price falls below the lower band for five consecutive days, indicating potential trend reversal
   - Stop-Loss Exit: Activated when price retraces 25% from the highest point, preventing excessive losses
3. Position Management: Uses a fixed percentage of account equity for position sizing, ensuring effective capital allocation

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Trend Following Stability: Filters out false breakouts by requiring five consecutive days of confirmation
2. Comprehensive Risk Control: Combines trend deviation and stop-loss mechanisms for dual protection
3. Flexible Parameters: Moving average periods and stop-loss percentage can be optimized for different market characteristics
4. Clear Execution Logic: Definitive entry and exit conditions reduce subjective judgment interference
5. Scientific Capital Management: Uses account proportion positioning rather than fixed lots for better risk control

#### Strategy Risks
1. Choppy Market Risk: Prone to false signals in sideways markets, leading to frequent trading
2. Slippage Risk: Stop-loss execution prices may significantly deviate from expectations in fast markets
3. Parameter Dependency: Optimal parameters may vary significantly across different market environments
4. Trend Lag: Moving averages introduce some delay at trend reversal points
5. Capital Efficiency: Strict holding conditions may miss some profit opportunities

#### Optimization Directions
1. Dynamic Parameter Optimization: Develop adaptive parameter systems that automatically adjust moving average periods based on market volatility
2. Market Environment Filtering: Add trend strength indicators to automatically reduce trading frequency in choppy markets
3. Multiple Timeframe Confirmation: Incorporate longer timeframe trend confirmation mechanisms to improve signal reliability
4. Stop-Loss Optimization: Introduce dynamic stop-loss mechanisms that automatically adjust based on volatility
5. Position Management Optimization: Dynamically adjust position sizing based on volatility and risk-reward ratios

#### Summary
This strategy constructs a complete trend following trading system through dual moving average channels, combining strict entry confirmation and dual exit mechanisms to achieve effective trend tracking and risk control. The strategy's strengths lie in its clear execution logic and comprehensive risk control, though it requires parameter optimization for different market environments and can be further improved through market environment filtering and multiple timeframe confirmation. Overall, it represents a structurally complete and logically rigorous quantitative trading strategy, suitable for application in markets with clear trends.[/trans]
