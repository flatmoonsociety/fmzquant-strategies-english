#### Overview
This strategy is a high-frequency quantitative trading system focused on capturing price breakout opportunities during the London and US trading sessions. It achieves stable trading returns through customized trading periods (Kill Zones), dynamic position management and precise order management. The core of the strategy is to establish a complete trading framework by analyzing the price behavior within a specific period of time and combining the high and low point data of the lookback cycle.
#### Strategy Principle
The strategy mainly operates based on the following core principles:
1. Time period selection: The strategy focuses on London and US trading hours, which generally have higher liquidity and volatility.
2. Breakthrough signal: Identify potential breakthrough opportunities by analyzing the relationship between the current closing price and the opening price, and comparing it with previous highs and lows.
3. Dynamic position: Dynamically calculate the position size of each transaction based on account equity, risk percentage and stop loss distance.
4. Order management: Implemented an automatic cancellation mechanism for pending orders to avoid potential risks caused by expired orders.
5. Risk-return ratio: Allow traders to set the risk-return ratio based on personal risk preferences.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Precise time management: Ensure trading at the most liquid time by customizing trading periods.
2. Intelligent position management: dynamically calculate the position size and effectively control the risk exposure of each transaction.
3. Flexible parameter configuration: Traders can adjust various parameters according to personal needs.
4. Complete risk control: including multiple risk control mechanisms such as stop loss, stop profit and order timeout cancellation.
5. High degree of automation: The entire process from signal generation to order management is automated, reducing human intervention.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Market volatility risk: False breakthrough signals may be triggered during periods of high volatility.
2. Slippage risk: Slippage in high-frequency trading may affect strategy performance.
3. False breakthrough risk: The market may experience false breakthroughs, resulting in trading losses.
4. Liquidity risk: Insufficient liquidity during a specific period may affect order execution.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce volatility filter: optimize entry timing by analyzing market volatility.
2. Add trend filtering: Combine with longer-term trend indicators to improve the accuracy of trading direction.
3. Optimize time window: Finely adjust trading period settings based on historical data analysis.
4. Improve position management: Consider adding a dynamic position adjustment mechanism based on volatility.
#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete high-frequency trading system by comprehensively using management methods from multiple dimensions such as time, price, and position. Its core advantage lies in its precise grasp of trading timing and complete risk management mechanism, but it also requires traders to pay close attention to changes in the market environment and adjust parameter settings in a timely manner. ||

// Description: 
// The ENIGMA ENDGAME strategy leverages price action breakouts within specific kill zones (London and US sessions) to capture profitable opportunities. 
// The strategy uses dynamic position sizing based on account equity, precise entry logic via buy-stop and sell-stop orders, and robust risk management to achieve consistent profitability. 
// Features include:
// - Customizable kill zones for session-specific trading.
// - Risk management with dynamic position sizing based on user-defined percentages.
// - Multiple entry opportunities with lookback-based high/low tracking.
// - Automatic pending order cancellation to avoid stale trades.
// - Adjustable risk-reward ratios for optimal profit-taking.
