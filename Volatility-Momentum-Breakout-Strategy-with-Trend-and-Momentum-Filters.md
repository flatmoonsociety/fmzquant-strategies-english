#### Overview
This strategy is a quantitative trading system that combines volatility breakouts, trend following, and momentum confirmations. It identifies trading opportunities by calculating dynamic breakout levels based on ATR, combined with EMA trend filtering and RSI momentum indicators. The strategy uses strict risk control measures, including fixed percentage risk management and dynamic stop loss settings.
#### Strategy Principle
The strategy has three core components:
1. Volatility breakthrough calculation: use the highest price and lowest price within the lookback period, combined with the ATR multiple to calculate the dynamic breakthrough threshold to avoid forward-looking bias.
2. Trend filtering: Use short-term EMA to determine the current trend direction, only open long orders when the price is above the EMA, and open short orders when the price is below the EMA.
3. Momentum confirmation: Use the RSI indicator to confirm market momentum. Long entry requires RSI to be greater than 50, and short entry requires RSI to be less than 50.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Dynamic adaptability: The breakthrough level will automatically adjust according to market volatility, allowing the strategy to adapt to different market environments.
2. Multiple filters: Combine trend and momentum indicators to reduce false signals.
3. Strict risk control: Use fixed risk percentages for position management and use dynamic stop loss protection.
4. Strong customizability: key parameters such as ATR cycle, breakthrough multiple, EMA cycle, etc. can be adjusted according to specific needs.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Lagging risk: Using indicators such as moving averages may cause entry points to lag.
2. Risk of volatile market: Frequent false breakthrough signals may occur in a volatile market.
3. Parameter sensitivity: Strategy performance is sensitive to parameter settings and needs to be fully tested.
Solution:
- It is recommended to perform backtest optimization in different market environments
- Market environment identification module can be added
- A more conservative money management approach is recommended
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Market environment adaptation: Add volatility range judgment and use different parameter settings in different volatility environments.
2. Signal optimization: Consider adding volume confirmation to improve the reliability of breakthrough signals.
3. Optimization of stop-profit and stop-loss: dynamically adjusted profit-loss ratio can be achieved, and targets can be adjusted according to market volatility.
4. Time filtering: Add trading time window filtering to avoid trading during unfavorable periods.
#### Summary
This is a quantitative trading strategy with complete structure and clear logic. Capture significant price moves while controlling risk by combining volatility breakouts, trend following, and momentum confirmations. The strategy is highly customizable and suitable for further optimization to adapt to different trading varieties and market environments. It is recommended to conduct sufficient parameter optimization and backtest verification before real trading. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is a quantitative trading system that combines volatility breakout, trend following, and momentum confirmation. It identifies trading opportunities by calculating ATR-based dynamic breakthrough levels combined with EMA trend filtering and RSI momentum indicators. The strategy employs strict risk control measures, including fixed percentage risk management and dynamic stop-loss settings.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy consists of three core components:
1. Volatility Breakout Calculation: Uses highest and lowest prices within the lookback period, combined with ATR multiplier to calculate dynamic breakthrough thresholds, avoiding look-ahead bias.
2. Trend Filtering: Uses short-term EMA to determine current trend direction, only taking long positions above EMA and short positions below EMA.
3. Momentum Confirmation: Uses RSI indicator to confirm market momentum, requiring RSI above 50 for long entries and below 50 for short entries.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dynamic Adaptability: Breakthrough levels automatically adjust based on market volatility, allowing the strategy to adapt to different market environments.
2. Multiple Filters: Combines trend and momentum indicators to reduce false signals.
3. Strict Risk Control: Uses fixed risk percentage for position management and dynamic stop-loss protection.
4. High Customizability: Key parameters such as ATR period, breakthrough multiplier, EMA period can be adjusted according to specific needs.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Lag Risk: Using moving averages may lead to delayed entry points.
2. Sideways Market Risk: May generate frequent false breakthrough signals in ranging markets.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: Strategy performance is sensitive to parameter settings, requiring thorough testing.
Solutions:
- Recommend backtesting and optimization under different market conditions
- Can add market environment recognition module
- Suggest adopting more conservative money management approach

#### Optimization Directions
1. Market Environment Adaptation: Add volatility range judgment, using different parameter settings in different volatility environments.
2. Signal Optimization: Consider adding volume confirmation to improve breakthrough signal reliability.
3. Stop Profit/Loss Optimization: Implement dynamically adjusting risk-reward ratio based on market volatility.
4. Time Filtering: Add trading time window filters to avoid trading during unfavorable periods.

#### Summary
This is a well-structured quantitative trading strategy with clear logic. By combining volatility breakout, trend following, and momentum confirmation, it captures significant price movements while controlling risk. The strategy's high customizability makes it suitable for further optimization to adapt to different trading instruments and market environments. It is recommended to conduct thorough parameter optimization and backtesting before live trading.[/trans]

//@version=5
// Volatility Momentum Breakout Strategy
//
// Description:
// This strategy is designed to capture significant price moves by combining a volatility breakout method
// with a momentum filter. Volatility is measured by the Average True Range (ATR), which is used to set dynamic
// breakout levels. A short‑term Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is applied as a trend filter, and the Relative
// Strength Index (RSI) is used to help avoid entries when the market is overextended.
// 
// Signal Logic:
// • Long Entry: When the current close is above the highest high of the previous N bars (excluding the current bar)
//   plus a multiple of ATR, provided that the price is above the short‑term EMA and the RSI is above 50.
// • Short Entry: When the current close is below the lowest low of the previous N bars (excluding the current bar)
//   minus a multiple of ATR, provided that the price is below the short‑term EMA and the RSI is below 50.
// 
// Risk Management:
// • Trades are sized to risk 2% of account equity.
// • A stop loss is placed at a fixed ATR multiple away from the entry price.
// • A take profit target is set to achieve a 1:2 risk‑reward ratio.
// 
// Backtesting Parameters:
// • Initial Capital: $10,000
// • Commission: 0.1% per trade
// • Slippage: 1 tick per bar
//
// Disclaimer:
// Past performance is not indicative of future results. This strategy is experimental and provided solely for educational
// purposes. Always backtest and paper trade before any live deployment.
