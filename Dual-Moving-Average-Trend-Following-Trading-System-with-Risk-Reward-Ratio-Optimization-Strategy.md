[trans]In the field of quantitative trading, trend following strategies have always been one of the most popular trading methods. This article will introduce a trend following strategy based on a dual moving average system, which improves trading efficiency through an optimized risk-return ratio.
#### Strategy Overview
This strategy uses the 20-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA) as the main indicators, combined with a 3:1 risk-return ratio to make trading decisions. When the price breaks above the 20-day moving average and the 20-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, the system will issue a buy signal. Fixed stop loss (-0.5%) and profit (1.5%) levels are set for each transaction to ensure that the risk is controllable.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy includes the following key elements:
1. Use the 20-day and 200-day EMA to determine market trends. The 200-day EMA represents the long-term trend, and the 20-day EMA reflects the short-term trend.
2. When the price breaks through the 20-day moving average and the 20-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, it indicates that the market is in an upward trend.
3. Adopt a risk-benefit ratio of 3:1, that is, the profit-taking point (1.5%) is three times the stop-loss point (0.5%)
4. Set variables to track transaction status and avoid repeated entries.
5. When the price falls below the 20-day moving average, the trading status is reset to prepare for the next transaction.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. The dual moving average system can effectively filter market noise and improve the reliability of trading signals.
2. A fixed risk-benefit ratio helps achieve long-term stable profitability.
3. Clear entry and exit rules to reduce subjective judgments
4. High degree of automation, easy to implement and backtest
5. The risk control mechanism is perfect, and each transaction has a clear stop loss level.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Frequent false signals may occur in sideways markets
2. Fixed stop-loss and take-profit positions may not be suitable for all market environments
3. Failure to consider transaction costs that may affect actual returns
4. In high-volatility markets, stop-loss positions may be too close to the entry point
5. Failure to consider market liquidity factors
#### Optimization direction
1. Introduce quantity and energy indicators to improve the accuracy of trend judgment
2. Dynamically adjust stop-loss and stop-profit positions based on market volatility
3. Add trend strength filter to reduce false signals
4. Consider adding market sentiment indicators
5. Optimize the position management system to achieve better fund management
#### Summary
This is a trend following strategy with complete structure and clear logic. By combining the dual moving average system and a fixed risk-to-return ratio, the strategy can ensure returns while also well controlling risks. Although there are still some areas that need optimization, overall this is a trading system worthy of further study and improvement. ||
In the field of quantitative trading, trend following strategies have always been one of the most popular trading methods. This article introduces a trend following strategy based on a dual moving average system, which improves trading efficiency through optimized risk-reward ratios.

#### Strategy Overview
This strategy uses 20-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA) as primary indicators, combined with a 3:1 risk-reward ratio for trading decisions. Buy signals are generated when the price breaks above the 20-day EMA and the 20-day EMA is above the 200-day EMA. Each trade has fixed stop-loss (-0.5%) and take-profit (1.5%) levels to ensure controlled risk.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic includes several key elements:
1. Uses 20-day and 200-day EMAs to judge market trends, with the 200-day EMA representing long-term trend and 20-day EMA reflecting short-term movements
2. A buy signal is generated when price breaks above the 20-day EMA and the 20-day EMA is above the 200-day EMA, indicating an upward trend
3. Employs a 3:1 risk-reward ratio, with take-profit level (1.5%) being three times the stop-loss level (0.5%)
4. Uses variables to track trade status and avoid duplicate entries
5. Resets trade status when price falls below 20-day EMA, preparing for the next trade

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dual moving average system effectively filters market noise and improves signal reliability
2. Fixed risk-reward ratio supports long-term profitable trading
3. Clear entry and exit rules reduce subjective judgment
4. High degree of automation, easy to implement and backtest
5. Comprehensive risk control mechanism with clear stop-loss levels for each trade

#### Strategy Risks
1. May generate frequent false signals in ranging markets
2. Fixed stop-loss and take-profit levels may not suit all market conditions
3. Trading costs not considered may affect actual returns
4. Stop-loss placement may be too close to entry in high-volatility markets
5. Market liquidity factors not considered

#### Optimization Directions
1. Introduce volume indicators to improve trend judgment accuracy
2. Dynamically adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels based on market volatility
3. Add trend strength filters to reduce false signals
4. Consider incorporating market sentiment indicators
5. Optimize position management system for better money management

#### Summary
This is a well-structured trend following strategy with clear logic. By combining a dual moving average system with fixed risk-reward ratios, the strategy achieves good returns while maintaining risk control. Though there are areas for optimization, it's overall a trading system worthy of further research and improvement.[/trans]
