#### Overview
This is a two-way trend following strategy based on SMMA (Smoothed Moving Average). This strategy uses the intersection of price and SMMA to generate long and short signals, and combines ATR dynamic stop loss and fixed profit target to manage risk and return. The strategy design is simple and effective, suitable for trend following transactions in different time periods.
#### Strategy Principle
The core of the strategy is to capture trend changes through the intersection of the 17-period SMMA and price. When the price crosses above the SMMA, a long position is opened; when the price crosses below the SMMA, a short position is opened. Exit management adopts a three-fold mechanism: 1) Dynamic stop loss based on ATR, set to 0.75 times ATR above and below SMMA; 2) Fixed profit target, 1150 points for longs and 1500 points for shorts; 3) Reverse cross signal closing. This combination not only protects profits, but also gives the trend ample room to develop.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. The signal system is stable and reliable: SMMA is smoother than the simple moving average and can effectively reduce false signals.
2. Comprehensive risk management: Combined with ATR dynamic stop loss and fixed profit target, it not only adapts to changes in market volatility, but also locks in reasonable returns.
3. Two-way trading: fully grasp the two-way market opportunities and improve capital utilization efficiency
4. Strong scalability: The strategy framework is clear and easy to implement in different markets and time periods.
5. The operating rules are clear: entry and exit conditions are objective, reducing interference caused by subjective judgments
#### Strategy Risk
1. Volatile market risk: Frequent trading may lead to losses in a volatile market.
2. Slippage risk: fixed-point profit targets may face slippage in fast markets
3. Trend reversal risk: When a strong trend suddenly reverses, ATR stop loss may not be fast enough.
4. Parameter dependence: The selection of SMMA cycle and ATR multiple has a greater impact on strategy performance
5. Fund management risk: fixed percentage positions may not be flexible enough when volatility changes
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introducing trend strength filtering: ADX and other indicators can be added to screen strong trends and reduce false signals in volatile markets.
2. Dynamic profit target: Consider using ATR to dynamically adjust profit targets to better adapt to market conditions.
3. Improve position management: introduce volatility-weighted position calculation to optimize capital utilization efficiency
4. Multi-time period confirmation: Increase longer period trend confirmation and improve transaction quality
5. Adapt to the market environment: add market type judgment logic and adjust strategy parameters under different market conditions
#### Summary
This is a well-designed trend following strategy that captures trends through SMMA crosses, uses ATR for risk control, and manages returns with fixed profit targets. The strategy logic is clear, simple to implement, and has good operability and scalability. Although the performance may not be good in volatile markets, the stability and adaptability of the strategy can be further improved through the suggested optimization directions. For traders who prefer trend following, this is a strategy framework worth paying attention to.

#### Overview
This is a dual-direction trend-following strategy based on SMMA (Smoothed Moving Average). The strategy generates long and short signals through price-SMMA crossovers, combining ATR-based dynamic stop-loss and fixed take-profit targets for risk and reward management. The strategy design is concise and effective, suitable for trend following across different timeframes.
#### Strategy Principles
The core mechanism relies on price crossovers with a 17-period SMMA to capture trend changes. Long positions are initiated when price crosses above SMMA, while short positions are taken when price crosses below SMMA. Exit management employs a triple mechanism: 1) ATR-based dynamic stop-loss set at 0.75 times ATR above/below SMMA; 2) Fixed take-profit targets of 1150 points for longs and 1500 points for shorts; 3) Reverse crossover signals for position closure. This combination both protects profits and allows trends to develop fully.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Stable signal system: SMMA provides smoother signals compared to simple moving averages, effectively reducing false signals
2. Comprehensive risk management: Combines ATR-based dynamic stops with fixed profit targets, adapting to market volatility while securing reasonable profits
3. Dual-direction trading: Fully captures bilateral market opportunities, improving capital efficiency
4. High scalability: Clear strategy framework, easily implementable across different markets and timeframes
5. Clear operational rules: Objective entry and exit conditions minimize subjective interference

#### Strategy Risks
1. Choppy market risk: Frequent trades in ranging markets may lead to losses
2. Slippage risk: Fixed point profit targets may face slippage in fast markets
3. Trend reversal risk: ATR stops may not react quickly enough to sudden trend reversals
4. Parameter dependency: Strategy performance heavily relies on SMMA period and ATR multiplier choices
5. Money management risk: Fixed percentage position sizing may lack flexibility during volatility changes

#### Optimization Directions
1. Introduce trend strength filtering: Add indicators like ADX to screen for strong trends, reducing false signals in ranging markets
2. Dynamic profit targets: Consider using ATR to dynamically adjust profit targets for better market adaptation
3. Improved position sizing: Implement volatility-weighted position calculation for optimized capital efficiency
4. Multi-timeframe confirmation: Add longer timeframe trend confirmation to improve trade quality
5. Market environment adaptation: Include market type classification logic to adjust strategy parameters under different market conditions

#### Summary
This is a well-designed trend-following strategy that captures trends through SMMA crossovers, implements risk control using ATR, and manages profits with fixed targets. The strategy logic is clear, implementation is straightforward, with good operability and extensibility. While performance may suffer in ranging markets, the suggested optimization directions can further enhance strategy stability and adaptability. For traders who prefer trend following, this represents a noteworthy strategy framework.[/trans]
