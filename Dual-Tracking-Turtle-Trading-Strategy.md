### Overview
This strategy uses the turtle trading rule to set up two trailing stop points, limit losses through dual trailing stops, and set different parameters to filter out market noise and buy when the trend is obvious.
### Strategy Principles
This strategy mainly determines the buying opportunity through two trailing stop loss points long_1 and long_2. Among them, long_1 tracks the longer-term trend, and long_2 tracks the shorter-term trend. At the same time, set profit1 and profit2 as stop loss points.
If the price is higher than long_1, the market is in a longer-term upward trend. At this time, if the price is lower than long_2, it means that shorterm has a callback and provides a better entry opportunity, so enter the market to do long; if the price is lower than long_1, then there is no definite trend in the longer term. If the price of shorterm is higher than long_2, it means that there is a short-term rebound, and you can also enter the market.
After entering the market, set two trailing stop loss points stoploss1 and stoploss2, and compare them with profit1 and profit2 to get the maximum value to lock in the profit.
### Advantage Analysis
- Through double tracking stop loss, you can effectively control risks and lock in profits to the greatest extent
- Combining long-term and short-term indicators can filter out some noise and enter the market when the trend is clearer
- The conservatism of the free control strategy can be adjusted through parameters
### Risk Analysis
- The strategy is relatively conservative and it is easy to miss some opportunities
- Improper stop loss setting may result in premature stop loss
- The number of transactions is small, and the loss in a single transaction may be larger.
You can make the strategy more aggressive and increase the number of transactions by appropriately adjusting the parameters of long and profit. At the same time, the stop loss point algorithm is optimized to realize automatic adjustment.
### Optimization direction
- Optimize the parameters of long and profit to find the optimal parameter combination
- Try zigzag stop loss or shadow stop loss algorithm to reduce unnecessary stop loss
- Add opening conditions to filter out noise and find clearer trends
- Combine with volume indicators to find real breakouts
### Summarize
This strategy is generally conservative and suitable for investors with stable growth. Through parameter adjustment and stop-loss algorithm optimization, the aggressiveness of the strategy can be appropriately increased. In addition, adding a mechanism to filter market noise is also a subsequent optimization direction.

### Overview

This strategy utilizes two tracking stop loss points based on the turtle trading rules to limit losses, while setting different parameters to filter out market noise and enter on more pronounced trends.

### Strategy Logic  

The strategy primarily relies on two tracking stop loss points, long_1 and long_2, to determine entry signals. Long_1 tracks the longer term trend while long_2 tracks the shorter term. Profit1 and profit2 act as the stop loss points.   

If price is above long_1, the market is in a longer term uptrend. If price then drops below long_2, it indicates a short term pullback providing good entry opportunity to go long. If price is below long_1, there is no confirmed longer term trend. But if price then surpasses long_2, it signals a short term bounce and can also take long position.

After entering, two tracking stop losses stoploss1 and stoploss2 are set and compared with profit1 and profit2 to take the maximum value, in order to lock in profits.

### Advantage Analysis

- Dual tracking stop loss effectively controls risks and locks in profits
- Combining both long term and short term indicators filters out some noise and enters on more pronounced trends  
- Flexibility to adjust conservatism of strategy by tuning parameters

### Risk Analysis  

- Strategy is conservative and could miss some opportunities 
- Improper stop loss setting may prematurely exit  
- Less trades so single losing trade impact could be big

Can make strategy more aggressive by adjusting long and profit parameters for more trades. Also optimize stop loss algorithms for adaptive adjustments.

### Optimization Directions   

- Find optimal parameter combinations for long and profit
- Experiment with zigzag or shadow stop losses to reduce unnecessary stops
- Add more entry filters to detect stronger established trends 
- Incorporate volume indicators to catch true breakouts 

### Summary

This is an overall conservative strategy suited for investors seeking steady growth. By tuning parameters and optimizing stop loss algorithms, aggression can be increased. Adding mechanisms to filter out market noise is also a direction for further optimizations.
