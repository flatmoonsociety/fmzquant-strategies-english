## Overview
This strategy forms a hammy lamp chandelier pattern by identifying the K line, and combines the SMA moving average judgment to conduct reversal transactions. When the Hami Chandelier pattern appears, if the opening and closing prices are outside the moving average, a trading signal is generated. The long signal is the hanging man, and the short signal is the hanging man.
## Principle
This strategy is mainly based on the following principles:
1. Identify the shape of Hami lamp chandelier by calculating the opening and closing price range and the overall rise and fall.
2. Determine whether the closing price of the previous K line is higher or lower than the highest price and lowest price of the current K line to avoid false signals.
3. Determine the relationship between the opening and closing prices and the SMA moving average to form a reversal signal
4. When the shape of the Hami lamp chandelier is recognized and the conditions are met, a long or short signal is generated
The main steps of the code are as follows:
1. Calculate SMA moving average
2. Loop to determine whether the shape of Hami lamp chandelier is formed
3. Determine the relationship between the closing price of the previous K line and the highest and lowest price of the current K line
4. Determine the relationship between the opening and closing prices and the moving average, and confirm the reversal signal
5. Draw signal markers and output long and short signals
## Advantage Analysis
This strategy has the following advantages:
1. Hami lamp chandelier has a clear shape and is easy to identify and implement.
2. Combined with moving average filtering, false signals can be reduced.
3. The long and short signals are clear and the operations are clear.
4. Reversal trading captures short-term trends.
5. Parameters can be flexibly adjusted to adapt to different market environments.
6. Easy to understand and implement, novice-friendly.
## Risk Analysis
There are also some risks with this strategy:
1. Relying on a single form and easily affected by false market breakthroughs.
2. Without a stop-loss mechanism, losses cannot be effectively controlled.
3. Improper parameter settings may lead to too frequent transactions.
4. It needs to be combined with trend judgment to perform poorly in trending markets.
5. The effect depends on parameter optimization and requires continuous optimization and testing.
Corresponding solutions:
1. Filter signals in combination with other indicators.
2. Add a stop-loss mechanism and strictly control risks.
3. Optimize parameters and control transaction frequency.
4. Only use it in the consolidation area to avoid going against the trend.
5. Continuously backtest optimization and review the results regularly.
## Optimization direction
This strategy can continue to be optimized in the following ways:
1. Increase trading volume filtering to avoid false breakthroughs.
2. Add a stop loss mechanism. Such as trailing stop loss, dead cross stop loss, etc.
3. Optimize parameters based on market structure. Such as trend and consolidation environment parameter differentiation.
4. Confirm the signal in conjunction with other indicators. Such as MACD, KDJ, etc.
5. Increase trend judgment and avoid counter-trend transactions.
6. Optimize cycle period parameters and balance FREQ and signal quality.
## Summarize
This strategy uses the chandelier line shape combined with SMA moving average judgment to achieve efficient reversal trading. It has the advantages of simple signal and easy operation. At the same time, there are also some risks and room for optimization. Through continuous optimization and testing, this strategy can become an efficient and stable short-term trading strategy.

## Overview

This strategy identifies doji candlestick patterns and combines SMA to determine reversals for trading. It generates trading signals when doji patterns form and the open/close prices are outside the SMA lines. Bullish signals are generated on hanging man lines and bearish signals on shooting star lines.

## Principles 

The main principles of this strategy are:

1. Identifying doji patterns by calculating the range of open/close prices vs the overall price movement.

2. Checking if previous close is above/below current high/low to avoid false signals. 

3. Judging open/close prices in relation to SMA lines to generate reversal signals.

4. Generating long/short signals when qualified doji patterns are identified.

The main steps in the code are:

1. Calculating SMA lines

2. Looping through candles to identify doji patterns

3. Checking previous close vs current high/low relationship 

4. Confirming reversal signals based on open/close and SMA relationship

5. Plotting signal markers and outputting long/short signals

## Advantages

The advantages of this strategy include:

1. Doji patterns are clear and easy to identify/implement.

2. SMA filters help reduce false signals. 

3. Clear long/short signals make trading operations straightforward. 

4. Reversal trading captures short-term trends.

5. Flexible parameters can adapt to different market conditions.

6. Easy to understand and implement, beginner friendly.

## Risks

Some potential risks:

1. Reliance on single pattern, prone to false breakouts. 

2. No stop loss mechanism to control losses.

3. Bad parameter tuning can lead to over-trading. 

4. Trend-reliant, underperforms in trending markets.

5. Performance relies on parameter optimization.

Solutions:

1. Add other filters to confirm signals.

2. Implement stop loss to manage risks.

3. Optimize parameters and limit trade frequency. 

4. Use mainly during range-bound markets.

5. Continual backtesting and optimization.

## Improvement Areas

Some ways to improve the strategy:

1. Add volume filter to avoid false breakouts.

2. Implement stop loss mechanisms like trailing stop loss.

3. Optimize parameters based on market conditions like trends.

4. Add other indicators to confirm signals, like MACD, KDJ etc.

5. Add trend determination to avoid counter-trend trading. 

6. Optimize lookback period to balance frequency and quality.

## Summary

This strategy uses doji patterns with SMA for efficient reversal trading. It has advantages like simple rules and easy trading. But also has risks and areas for improvement. With continual optimization it can become a solid short-term trading system.
