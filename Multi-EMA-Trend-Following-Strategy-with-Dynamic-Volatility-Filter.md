#### Overview
This strategy is an intelligent trading system that combines trend following and volatility filtering. It identifies market trends through exponential moving averages (EMA), uses true range (TR) and dynamic volatility filters to determine entry timing, and uses volatility-based dynamic stop-profit and stop-loss mechanisms to manage risk. The strategy supports two trading modes: short-term (Scalp) and swing (Swing), which can be flexibly switched according to different market environments and trading styles.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy includes the following key components:
1. Trend identification: Use the 50-period EMA as a trend filter, only go long when the price is above the EMA, and go short when the price is below the EMA.
2. Volatility filtering: Calculate the EMA of the true volatility (TR) and use an adjustable filtering coefficient (default 1.5) to filter market noise.
3. Entry conditions: Combined with the morphological analysis of three consecutive K lines, the price movement is required to have continuity and acceleration characteristics.
4. Stop profit and stop loss: Based on the current TR setting in short-term mode and based on previous high and low point settings in band mode, dynamic risk management is achieved.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Strong adaptability: Through the combination of dynamic volatility filtering and trend tracking, it can adapt to different market environments.
2. Improved risk management: Provides two trading modes with dynamic stop-profit and stop-loss mechanisms, which can be flexibly selected according to market characteristics.
3. Good parameter adjustability: Key parameters such as filter coefficients, trend cycles, etc. can be optimized according to the characteristics of trading varieties.
4. Good visualization effect: Provide clear buy and sell signal marks and take profit and stop loss level display, which facilitates transaction monitoring.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Trend reversal risk: Continuous stop losses may occur at trend turning points.
2. False breakthrough risk: False signals may be triggered when volatility suddenly increases.
3. Parameter sensitivity: Improper setting of the filter coefficient may result in too much or too little signal.
4. Impact of slippage: In a fast market, you may face larger slippage, which affects the performance of your strategy.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Add trend strength filtering: ADX and other indicators can be introduced to evaluate the trend strength and improve the trend tracking effect.
2. Optimize stop-profit and stop-loss: Consider introducing trailing stop-loss to protect more profits.
3. Improve the band model: more judgment conditions unique to band trading can be added to improve medium and long-term position holding capabilities.
4. Increase trading volume analysis: Combined with trading volume changes to confirm the effectiveness of breakthroughs.
#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete trading system by organically combining trend tracking, volatility filtering and dynamic risk management. The advantage of the strategy is that it has strong adaptability, controllable risks, and provides a large space for optimization. By properly setting parameters and selecting appropriate trading modes, this strategy can maintain stable performance in different market environments. It is recommended that traders conduct sufficient backtesting and parameter optimization before using it in real trading, and make corresponding adjustments according to the characteristics of specific trading varieties. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is an intelligent trading system that combines trend following with volatility filtering. It identifies market trends using Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), determines entry timing through True Range (TR) and dynamic volatility filters, and manages risk using a volatility-based dynamic stop-loss/take-profit mechanism. The strategy supports two trading modes: Scalp and Swing, which can be flexibly switched based on different market environments and trading styles.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic includes the following key components:
1. Trend Identification: Uses 50-period EMA as a trend filter, only taking long positions above EMA and short positions below EMA.
2. Volatility Filtering: Calculates EMA of True Range (TR) and uses an adjustable filter coefficient (default 1.5) to filter market noise.
3. Entry Conditions: Combines analysis of three consecutive candles, requiring price movement to show continuity and acceleration characteristics.
4. Stop-Loss/Take-Profit: Set based on current TR in scalp mode and based on previous highs/lows in swing mode, achieving dynamic risk management.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Strong Adaptability: Adapts to different market environments through the combination of dynamic volatility filtering and trend following.
2. Comprehensive Risk Management: Provides dynamic stop-loss/take-profit mechanisms for both trading modes, allowing flexible selection based on market characteristics.
3. Good Parameter Adjustability: Key parameters such as filter coefficient and trend period can be optimized according to trading instrument characteristics.
4. Excellent Visualization: Provides clear buy/sell signal markers and stop-loss/take-profit level displays for easy trade monitoring.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Trend Reversal Risk: May experience consecutive stops at trend turning points.
2. False Breakout Risk: May trigger false signals during sudden volatility increases.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: Improper filter coefficient settings may lead to too many or too few signals.
4. Slippage Impact: May face significant slippage in fast markets, affecting strategy performance.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Add Trend Strength Filtering: Can introduce indicators like ADX to evaluate trend strength and improve trend following effectiveness.
2. Optimize Stop-Loss/Take-Profit: Can consider introducing trailing stops to protect more profits.
3. Improve Swing Mode: Can add more swing-trading-specific conditions to enhance medium to long-term holding capability.
4. Add Volume Analysis: Combine volume changes to confirm breakout validity.

#### Summary
This strategy constructs a complete trading system by organically combining trend following, volatility filtering, and dynamic risk management. Its strengths lie in its adaptability, controllable risk, while providing significant optimization potential. Through proper parameter settings and appropriate trading mode selection, the strategy can maintain stable performance in different market environments. Traders are advised to conduct thorough backtesting and parameter optimization before live trading, and make appropriate adjustments based on specific trading instrument characteristics.[/trans]
