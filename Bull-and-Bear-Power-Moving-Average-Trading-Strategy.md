## Overview
This strategy was developed by Dr. Alexander Elder based on his elastic moving average theory to measure the buying and selling power of the market. This strategy is typically used in conjunction with a three-screen trading system, but can also be used on its own. Doctor uses the 13-day exponential moving average to reflect the market consensus on value. Bull power reflects the ability of buyers to drive prices above the value consensus; short power reflects the ability of sellers to drive prices below the value consensus.
Bull power is calculated by subtracting the 13-day exponential moving average from the high. Bear power is calculated by taking the low minus the 13-day exponential moving average.
## Strategy Principle
This strategy is based on Dr. Alexander Elder’s buying and selling power theory. Determine market trends and strength by calculating the long and short power indicator. Specifically, the Bull Power indicator reflects the power of buyers and is calculated by taking the highest price minus the 13-day EMA. The Bear Power indicator reflects the strength of sellers and is calculated by subtracting the 13-day EMA from the lowest price. When the bullish power drops to a certain threshold, a short signal is generated; when the bearish power rises to a certain threshold, a long signal is generated. In this way, we can judge the market trend and beat the market through the comparative power of strong buying and selling.
In the code, we use the high and low points and the 13-day EMA to calculate the long and short power indicator. Set the trigger threshold and open the corresponding long or short position when the indicator triggers. Also set stop loss and take profit logic to manage positions. Generally speaking, this strategy trades by comparing the relative strength of buyers and sellers to determine the strength of market trends.
## Advantage Analysis
This strategy has the following advantages:
1. Use buying and selling power to judge market trends, BACKTEST is more effective
2. The buying and selling signals are clear and easy to judge.
3. Reliable stop-loss mechanism HELP to control risks
4. The effect is better when combined with the three-screen trading system
## Risk Analysis
There are also some risks with this strategy:
1. Parameter settings are relatively subjective and need to be adjusted for different markets.
2. Buying and selling power indicators can produce misleading signals
3. Improper setting of stop loss position may increase losses
4. The effect is related to the trading type and cycle
Countermeasures:
1. Optimize parameters to adapt to different markets
2. Combine with other indicators to filter signals
3. Optimize stop loss logic and strictly control risks
4. Choose the appropriate trading type and cycle
## Optimization direction
This strategy can be optimized from the following aspects:
1. Optimize moving average parameters to adapt to different periods
2. Add other indicators to filter signals, such as MACD, etc.
3. Optimize stop loss and take profit logic, such as trailing stop loss
4. Use machine learning methods to automatically optimize parameters
5. Combined with deep learning to predict buying and selling signals
Generally speaking, this strategy has a large optimization space, and it can start from multiple aspects such as parameters, signals, and risk control to make the strategy more stable and reliable.
## Summarize
This strategy is based on Dr. Elder's buying and selling power theory and determines market trends and strength by calculating long and short power indicators. The signal judgment rules are relatively simple and clear. The strategy has the advantages of using buying and selling power to determine trends and stop losses to control risks, but it also has risks such as subjective parameters and misleading signals. We can further enhance the stability and profit rate of the strategy through parameter optimization, adding signal filtering, and strict stop loss. This strategy is suitable for active quantitative traders.

## Overview

This strategy was developed by Dr. Alexander Elder based on his theory of bull and bear power moving averages to measure buying and selling pressure in the market. It is commonly used together with the Triple Screen trading system but can also be used on its own. Dr. Elder uses a 13-day exponential moving average (EMA) to reflect the market consensus of value. Bull power reflects the ability of buyers to drive prices above the consensus of value. Bear power reflects the sellers’ ability to drive prices below the average consensus of value.  

Bull power is calculated by subtracting the 13-day EMA from the day's high. Bear Power subtracts the 13-day EMA from the day's low.  

## Strategy Logic

This strategy is based on Dr. Alexander Elder's theory of bull and bear power. It judges market trends and power by calculating bull and bear power indicators. Specifically, the bull power indicator reflects the power of buyers, which is calculated by subtracting the 13-day EMA from the highest price. The bear power indicator reflects the power of sellers, which is calculated by subtracting the 13-day EMA from the lowest price. When the bull power drops to a certain threshold, a short signal is generated. When the bear power rises to a certain threshold, a long signal is generated. Thus, we can judge the market trend and beat the market by comparing the relative strength of buying and selling power.

In the code, we use highs, lows and 13-day EMA to calculate the bull and bear power indicators. Set trigger thresholds so that corresponding long or short positions are opened when the indicators are triggered. At the same time, set stop loss and take profit logic to manage positions. Overall, this strategy compares the relative power of buyers and sellers to determine the strength of market trends for trading.

## Advantage Analysis 

The advantages of this strategy include:

1. Effective in judging market trends and backtesting using buying and selling power  
2. Clear buy and sell signals that are easy to judge
3. Reliable stop loss mechanism to control risk 
4. Works even better when combined with the Triple Screen trading system

## Risk Analysis

Some risks of this strategy include:

1. Subjective parameter settings that need adjusting for different markets
2. Bull and bear power indicators may produce misleading signals
3. Improper stop loss placement may increase losses
4. Performance depends on trading instruments and timeframes

Countermeasures:

1. Optimize parameters for different markets 
2. Add filters using other indicators 
3. Optimize stop loss logic to strictly control risk
4. Select suitable trading instruments and timeframes

## Optimization Directions

This strategy can be optimized in the following aspects:

1. Optimize moving average parameters for different timeframes  
2. Add other indicators like MACD to filter signals
3. Optimize stop loss and take profit logic, such as trail stop loss
4. Use machine learning to automatically optimize parameters  
5. Incorporate deep learning to predict buy/sell signals  

In summary, this strategy has much room for optimization in aspects like parameters, signals, risk control etc. to make it more robust and reliable.  

## Conclusion  

This strategy judges market trends and power using the bull and bear power indicators developed by Dr. Elder based on buying/selling power theory. The signal rules are relatively simple and clear. Advantages include judging trends via power and controlling risk through stop loss. It also has risks like subjective parameters and misleading signals. We can improve stability and profitability through optimizing parameters, adding signal filters and strict stop loss. This strategy suits aggressive quant traders.
