## Overview
This strategy uses the changes in the highest and lowest prices of the K-line to determine the direction and intensity of market shocks, and combines it with the moving average to determine the overall trend to achieve short-term operations. Mainly suitable for varieties with obvious shocks.
## Strategy Principle
This strategy first determines the change of the highest price and lowest price of the K line relative to the previous K line. If the highest price rises, it is recorded as 1, if the lowest price falls, it is recorded as -1, otherwise it is recorded as 0. Then calculate the average change of the highest price and lowest price within a certain period to determine the direction and intensity of market shocks.
At the same time, the strategy records the highest and lowest prices in the most recent period. When the moving average determines the trend turning point, the key price level is determined based on the recorded price, and the stop loss and take profit levels are formed.
The entry direction is judged according to the moving average, with longs buying above the upper track and shorts selling below the lower track. Stop loss and take profit levels are formed by judging key price levels.
## Advantage Analysis
The biggest advantage of this strategy is to make full use of the short-term shock characteristics to make profits. By judging key price levels and forming stop-loss and take-profit strategies, the strategy operates under clear rules. At the same time, it is combined with trend judgment to filter out unfavorable market conditions and avoid unnecessary losses.
## Risk Analysis
This strategy mainly faces the following risks:
1. If the market does not fluctuate, there will be no profit.
2. The price breaks through the stop loss level, causing unnecessary losses. The stop loss range can be appropriately relaxed.
3. If you misjudge the trend, you may miss the market or make reverse operations. The moving average parameters can be adjusted appropriately.
## Optimization direction
This strategy can be optimized from the following aspects:
1. Adjust the moving average period to adapt to the characteristics of different varieties.
2. Optimize the stop-profit and stop-loss ranges to balance profits and losses.
3. Add other indicator judgments to avoid incorrect operations.
4. Add automatic stop loss to control the maximum loss.
## Summarize
Generally speaking, this strategy is a strategy that takes advantage of the characteristics of short-term shocks. Take advantage of small price ranges to gain profits. At the same time, strictly control risks and stop losses promptly when the trend is unfavorable. Suitable for more cautious investors pursuing stable returns. If the parameters are adjusted appropriately, good results can be obtained in volatile market conditions.

## Overview

This strategy uses the changes in the highest and lowest prices of K-lines to judge the direction and intensity of market oscillation, and combines moving average to judge the overall trend to implement short-term operations. It is mainly suitable for varieties with obvious oscillations.

## Strategy Principle  

This strategy first judges the changes in the highest and lowest prices of K-lines relative to the previous K-line. If the highest price rises, it is recorded as 1. If the lowest price falls, it is recorded as -1, otherwise it is recorded as 0. Then calculate the mean value of changes in the highest and lowest prices within a certain cycle to judge the direction and intensity of market oscillation.

At the same time, the strategy records the highest and lowest prices in the most recent cycle. When the moving average determines a trend reversal, combined with the recorded prices to determine key price levels to form stop loss and take profit levels.

The entry direction is determined by the moving average. Go long above the upper rail and go short below the lower rail. The stop loss and take profit levels are formed by judging the key price levels.

## Advantage Analysis  

The biggest advantage of this strategy is to make full use of the characteristics of short-term fluctuations to make profits. By determining the stop loss and take profit based on key price levels, the strategy runs under clear rules. At the same time, it combines trend judgment to filter out unfavorable markets and avoid unnecessary losses.

## Risk Analysis

The main risks this strategy faces are:

1. No profit if the market is not fluctuating.  

2. Unnecessary losses caused by prices breaking through the stop loss level. The stop loss range can be appropriately expanded.

3. Wrong judgment of the trend may miss opportunities or make operations in the opposite direction. The moving average parameters can be adjusted accordingly.

## Optimization Directions

This strategy can be optimized in the following aspects:

1. Adjust the moving average cycle to adapt to the characteristics of different varieties.  

2. Optimize the stop profit and stop loss range to balance profit and loss.

3. Add other indicators for judgment to avoid wrong operations.  

4. Add automatic stop loss to control maximum loss.

## Summary  

In general, this strategy is one that takes advantage of short-term fluctuations. It makes full use of the small price movements to make profits. At the same time, it strictly controls risks and cuts losses in a timely manner when the trend is unfavorable. It is suitable for investors who pursue stable returns with relatively prudent attitude. With appropriate parameter adjustments, it can achieve good results in fluctuating markets.
