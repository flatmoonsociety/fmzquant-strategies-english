## Overview
The reversal trend breakout strategy is a combination strategy that combines the advantages of the reversal strategy and the breakout strategy and aims to issue trading signals at trend reversal points. This strategy first determines whether the price has a reversal pattern for two consecutive days, and whether the indicator Stochastic Oscillator sends a reversal signal. If so, it will generate a buy or sell signal. At the same time, this strategy will also determine whether the price breaks through the highest price or lowest price within the specified period. If the reversal and breakthrough conditions are met at the same time, a trading signal will be generated.
## Strategy Principle
The strategy consists of two parts:
1. Reversal part
It is judged that the price has reversed for two consecutive days (the closing price on the second day is higher than the first day, buy when the Stochastic fast line is lower than the slow line; the closing price on the second day is lower than the first day, sell when the fast line is higher than the slow line).
2. Breakthrough part
Determine whether the price breaks through the highest price in the look_bak period (if it breaks through the highest price, buy).
When the signals of the reversal part and the breakthrough part are in the same direction (for example, the reversal shows a buy signal and the breakthrough also shows a buy signal), an actual buy or sell signal is generated.
## Strategic Advantages
This combination strategy combines the advantages of reversal and trend breakout trading strategies and can more accurately capture signals at trend turning points.
1. The reversal part can send out signals when the price reverses and is suitable for capturing turning points.
2. The breakthrough part ensures that the direction of the trading signal is consistent with the trend and avoids trading in the wrong direction.
3. When the two parts send signals in the same direction, more reliable trading opportunities can be generated.
4. The application of Stochastic indicators avoids the subjectivity of judging based on price patterns alone.
## Risk and Optimization
There are also some risks to be aware of with this strategy:
1. The reversal signal may be a false breakthrough, and it is impossible to determine that the reversal trend has been established. may optimize it by:
2. The breakthrough signal may be an illusory breakthrough, and it is impossible to judge that the trend has started.
3. Improper setting of the two parts of indicator parameters may lead to missed trading opportunities.
4. The transaction frequency may be too high, and parameters can be adjusted appropriately to control the number of transactions.
Corresponding optimization measures:
1. Optimize the reversal indicator parameters to ensure that the reversal signal is more reliable.
2. Optimize breakthrough parameters to avoid false breakthroughs.
3. Adjust the parameter settings of the reversal and breakout parts to find the best match.
4. Appropriately adjust the transaction frequency to prevent too frequent transactions.
## Summarize
The reversal trend breakout strategy combines the advantages of reversal and trend breakout strategies to reliably send trading signals at price turning points. Through parameter optimization, you can control the trading frequency while improving signal quality and capturing reliable trading opportunities. This strategy is relatively stable overall, but attention needs to be paid to preventing risks caused by false breakthroughs and illusory breakthroughs.

## Overview

The Reversal Breakout Trend strategy is a combo strategy that combines the advantages of reversal and breakout strategies to generate trading signals at trend reversal points. It first judges if prices reverse during two consecutive days and if the Stochastic Oscillator gives reversal signals. At the same time, it also checks if prices break through the highest/lowest prices over a certain period. When reversal and breakout conditions are met, trading signals are generated.

## Strategy Logic 

The strategy consists of two parts:

1. Reversal Part

It judges if prices reverse during two consecutive days (buy when close of day 2 is higher than day 1 and Stochastic fast line is lower than slow line; sell when close of day 2 is lower than day 1 and fast line is higher than slow line).

2. Breakout Part

It judges if prices break through the highest price over the look_bak period (buy if price breaks through the highest price).

When reversal and breakout parts give signals in the same direction (e.g. reversal shows buy and breakout shows buy), actual buy/sell signals are generated.

## Advantages

This combo strategy combines the pros of reversal and trend breakout strategies and can more accurately capture signals at trend turning points:

1. The reversal part can generate signals when prices reverse, suitable to catch turning points.

2. The breakout part ensures trade direction is aligned with the trend, avoiding trading in wrong direction.

3. Signals in the same direction from both parts create more reliable trading opportunities. 

4. The application of Stochastic avoids the subjectivity of judging by price pattern alone.

## Risks and Optimization

There are also some risks to note:

1. Reversal signals may be false breakouts, unable to confirm the reversal trend has established.

2. Breakout signals may be false breakouts, unable to judge the trend has started. 

3. Improper parameter settings of the two parts may lead to missing trades.

4. High trading frequency may occur and needs to be controlled.

Possible optimizations:

1. Optimize parameters of reversal indicators to ensure reversal signals are more reliable.

2. Optimize breakout parameters to avoid false breakouts.  

3. Adjust parameters of both parts to find the optimal match.

4. Moderate the trading frequency to prevent over-trading.

## Summary 

The Reversal Breakout Trend strategy leverages the strengths of reversal and trend breakout strategies and reliably generates trading signals at turning points. Through parameter optimization, it can improve signal quality and capture solid trading opportunities while controlling trading frequency. Overall this strategy is robust but false breakouts remain a risk to watch out for. Proper optimization and parameter tuning is key.
