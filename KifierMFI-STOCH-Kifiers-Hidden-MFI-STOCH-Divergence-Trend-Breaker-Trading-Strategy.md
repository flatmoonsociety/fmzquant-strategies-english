### Overview
This is a general trading strategy designed for the cryptocurrency market. The purpose is to find better entry opportunities and carry out medium and long-term holdings in the bullish environment of the cryptocurrency market. The strategy comprehensively uses a variety of technical indicators such as MFI indicators, STOCH indicators, and VWMA indicators to capture potential trend reversal opportunities by judging hidden divergences.
### Strategy Principles
This strategy contains two entry logics:
1. MFI hidden divergence + STOCH filtering: When MFI forms a hidden divergence, that is, when the price reaches a new high but MFI does not reach a new high, we believe this is a potential trend reversal signal. But in order to avoid false signals, we additionally add STOCH>50% as a filter condition.
2. STOCH/MFI trend system: When STOCH>50% and MFI crosses the 50 line from bottom to top, it means that the market trend is forming, and you can get better risk returns by entering the market at this time.
To ensure the accuracy of trend judgment, we also built a trend system based on VWMA and SMA. Only when the VWMA crosses the SMA, that is, when the trend is determined to be upward, will the above two systems issue trading signals. In addition, we use the OBV indicator to determine whether the overall market is active or consolidating, which is also used to filter out some false signals.
The ATR indicator is used to judge whether the market is in a state of shock. We give priority to finding MFI hidden divergence in the shock market to intervene. The stop loss method is to set the stop loss price with reference to the recent support level. The take-profit method is to calculate a certain percentage of take-profit starting from the entry price.
### Advantage Analysis
This strategy uses a variety of indicators to judge the market structure and successfully avoids most of the noise. The hidden divergence system can provide high-probability and controllable-risk entry opportunities during the shock and adjustment stages. The STOCH/MFI trend system can gain additional benefits from clear trends. The stop-profit and stop-loss settings are reasonable to avoid the common mistakes of chasing the rise and killing the fall. The entire strategy is very suitable for highly volatile markets such as cryptocurrency and can achieve better risk-adjusted returns.
### Risk Analysis
The biggest risk of this strategy is that the hidden divergence judgment is not always reliable. It only reflects the changing market sentiment and does not guarantee that the price will reverse immediately. In addition, improper settings of STOCH and other indicators may result in missing trends or generating false signals. Finally, if the stop-profit and stop-loss settings are too aggressive, small may cause positions to be stopped and reopened too frequently, affecting the rate of return.
We filter signals by adding additional trend and market status judgments, and set more tolerant take-profit and stop-loss levels to reduce the above risks. Of course, if you cannot stop losses in time, it will be difficult to completely avoid huge losses when encountering major macro events.
### Optimization direction
There is room for further improvement of this strategy, mainly focusing on the following aspects:
1. Optimize the parameter settings of MFI and STOCH to improve the accuracy of hidden divergence judgment.
2. Add machine learning models to judge market conditions and backtest to determine the best parameters.
3. Try dynamic stop-profit and stop-loss to further control risks while ensuring profits.
4. Test the differences of different cryptocurrency varieties and set personalized parameters
5. Add a stock selection module to make the strategy more focused on individual stocks with better technical forms.
Through the above optimization points, we can expect to further improve the stability and profitability of the strategy.
### Summarize
This is a very practical cryptocurrency trading strategy. It correctly uses a variety of technical indicators to judge the market structure and obtain better returns under the premise of controllable risks. The main problem is that the judgment of hidden divergences is not always accurate, and we alleviate this problem through a series of filters. This strategy still has room to further improve stability and profitability, and is worthy of real-time testing and long-term tracking. It provides effective ideas for quantitative traders to obtain stable returns in the cryptocurrency market.

### Overview

This is a universal trading strategy designed for the crypto market, aiming to find good entry opportunities when being bullish on cryptos for mid-to-long term holding. It combines various technical indicators like MFI, STOCH, VWMA to identify potential trend reversal based on hidden divergence. 

### Trading Logic

The strategy has two entry logics:

1. MFI hidden divergence + STOCH filter: When there's a hidden divergence between price and MFI, i.e. price reaches new high but MFI does not, it indicates a potential trend reversal. To avoid false signals, we add STOCH>50% as a further filter.  

2. STOCH/MFI trend system: When STOCH>50% and MFI crosses above 50, it signals an uptrend in action. We can ride the trend for better risk-adjusted returns.

To ensure the accuracy of trend detection, a trend system comprised of VWMA and SMA is constructed. Entries are only allowed when VWMA crosses over SMA, confirming an upward trend. Besides, OBV is used to check if the overall market is active or ranging. This further filters out some false signals.  

ATR is used to determine if the market is ranging. We prefer to take entries on hidden divergence during range-bound markets. The stop loss is set based on recent support levels. Take profit exits when certain percentage of profits is reached based on entry price.

### Advantage Analysis  

The strategies combines various indicators to filter out market noise and avoid false signals. The hidden divergence system provides high-probability entries with controlled risk during ranging and corrective markets. The STOCH/MFI trend system generates additional profits when a clear trend establishes. Reasonable TP and SL settings prevent chasing momentum and stop hunts. The strategy suits the highly volatile crypto market very well for solid risk-adjusted returns.  

### Risk Analysis

The major risk is that hidden divergence does not always lead to an immediate reversal as it merely suggests shifting market sentiment. Noisy STOCH and other signals may result from bad parameter tuning. Overly tight TP/SL levels can also lead to excessive exits and re-entries, dragging down net profits.  

We tackle these issues via additional trend and market condition filters, more tolerant TP/SL levels, etc. Still significant losses may occur in case of major black swan events or a failure to cut loss in time.   

### Optimization Directions

There remains room for improving this strategy:

1. Optimize MFI/STOCH parameters for better hidden divergence accuracy  

2. Add ML models to determine market conditions and fine-tune parameters

3. Test dynamic TP/SL to balance profitability and risk control  

4. Check cross-asset differences and set personalized parameters

5. Add stock selection filters for better quality picks

These efforts can potentially enhance the stability and profitability further.  

### Conclusion

This is a very practical crypto trading strategy. It judiciously applies various technical indicators to determine market conditions and delivers solid risk-adjusted profits. The main caveat is hidden divergence does not always precisely predict immediate reversals. We handle this issue via a sequence of filters. There remains room for boosting stability and returns. It offers fruitful ideas for quants to harvest consistent gains in the crypto space.
