#### Overview
This is a trading strategy based on the analysis of the high and low points of the SMA (Simple Moving Average) over a one-year period based on the delta value of buying and selling volume. This strategy identifies potential trading signals by calculating a moving average of the difference between buy and sell volume and comparing it to historical high and low thresholds. The strategy uses a long-term lookback period and is suitable for mid- to long-term trend trading.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy is based on the following key steps:
1. Delta calculation: Calculate the difference between buying and selling volume by analyzing price trends. When the closing price is higher than the opening price, it is recorded as buying volume, and vice versa as selling volume.
2. SMA smoothing: perform a 14-period moving average processing on the Delta value to reduce noise.
3. Determination of one-year high and low points: Calculate the highest and lowest values ​​of Delta SMA in the past year.
4. Signal trigger conditions:
   - Buy signal: Triggered when Delta SMA breaks 0 after being 70% below the one-year low
   - Sell signal: Triggered when Delta SMA breaks through 90% of one-year high and falls below 60%
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Strong ability to grasp long-term trends: Through one-year historical data analysis, the main trends can be effectively captured.
2. Good noise filtering effect: SMA smoothing processing and multiple threshold conditions are used to effectively reduce false signals.
3. Reasonable risk control: clear entry and exit conditions are set to avoid excessive trading.
4. Strong adaptability: Strategy parameters can be adjusted according to different market conditions.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Lag risk: Due to the use of SMA and long lookback periods, signals may lag.
2. False breakthrough risk: False signals may be generated in volatile markets.
3. Dependence on market environment: It may perform poorly in markets where the trend is not obvious.
4. Parameter sensitivity: Threshold setting has a greater impact on policy performance.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Dynamic threshold adjustment: The high and low point thresholds can be dynamically adjusted according to market volatility.
2. Add auxiliary indicators: combine with other technical indicators to improve signal reliability.
3. Introduce a stop-loss mechanism: Set a dynamic stop-loss to control risks.
4. Market environment screening: Add market environment judgment logic and run strategies in a suitable environment.
#### Summary
This is a medium- and long-term trend following strategy based on trading volume analysis. It captures market trends by analyzing the historical high and low points of the difference between buying and selling volume. The strategy design is reasonable and risk control is in place, but attention needs to be paid to the adaptability of the market environment and parameter optimization. Through the proposed optimization direction, there is room for further improvement of the strategy. ||
#### Overview
This is a trading strategy based on analyzing the historical highs and lows of the Delta SMA (Simple Moving Average) of buy/sell volumes over a one-year period. The strategy identifies potential trading signals by comparing the Delta SMA with historical threshold values. It employs a long-term lookback period, making it suitable for medium to long-term trend trading.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic of the strategy is based on the following key steps:
1. Delta Calculation: Calculate the difference between buy and sell volumes based on price movement. Volume is recorded as buy volume when closing price is above opening price, and vice versa.
2. SMA Smoothing: Apply a 14-period moving average to the Delta value to reduce noise.
3. One-Year High/Low Determination: Calculate the highest and lowest values of Delta SMA over the past year.
4. Signal Trigger Conditions:
   - Buy Signal: Triggered when Delta SMA crosses above 0 after falling below 70% of the yearly low
   - Sell Signal: Triggered when Delta SMA falls below 60% after crossing above 90% of the yearly high

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Strong Long-term Trend Capture: Effectively captures major trends through one-year historical data analysis.
2. Excellent Noise Filtering: Uses SMA smoothing and multiple threshold conditions to effectively reduce false signals.
3. Reasonable Risk Control: Sets clear entry and exit conditions to avoid overtrading.
4. High Adaptability: Strategy parameters can be adjusted for different market conditions.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Lag Risk: Use of SMA and long lookback period may lead to delayed signals.
2. False Breakout Risk: May generate false signals in ranging markets.
3. Market Environment Dependency: May underperform in markets without clear trends.
4. Parameter Sensitivity: Threshold settings significantly impact strategy performance.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment: Dynamically adjust high/low thresholds based on market volatility.
2. Additional Indicators: Incorporate other technical indicators to improve signal reliability.
3. Stop-Loss Implementation: Implement dynamic stop-loss mechanisms for risk control.
4. Market Environment Filtering: Add market environment assessment logic to run the strategy in suitable conditions.

#### Summary
This is a medium to long-term trend following strategy based on volume analysis, capturing market trends by analyzing historical highs and lows of buy/sell volume differences. The strategy is well-designed with proper risk control, but attention needs to be paid to market environment adaptability and parameter optimization. Through the proposed optimization directions, there is room for further strategy improvement.[/trans]
