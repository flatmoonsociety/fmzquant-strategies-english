#### Overview
This is a reversal trading strategy based on the RSI indicator and volume. This strategy identifies overbought and oversold conditions in the market, combined with volume confirmation, and takes reverse trades when prices reach extreme states. The core idea of ​​the strategy is to trade when the RSI indicator shows an overbought or oversold signal and the trading volume is above average, using the RSI midline (50) as an exit signal.
#### Strategy Principles
The strategy is mainly based on the following core components:
1. RSI indicator calculation: Use the 14-period RSI indicator to monitor price momentum
2. Volume confirmation: Use the 20-period volume moving average (SMA)
3. Entry logic:
   - Long entry: when RSI is below 30 (oversold) and volume is above its moving average
   - Short entry: when RSI is above 70 (overbought) and volume is greater than its moving average
4. Appearance logic:
   - Bull exit: RSI crosses 50
   - Short exit: RSI crosses 50
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Systematic trading decisions: establish an objective trading system through a clear combination of technical indicators
2. Multiple confirmation mechanism: combines the two dimensions of RSI and trading volume to improve signal reliability
3. Improved risk control: use percentage fund management and prohibit repeated opening of positions
4. Visual support: Contains complete chart display functions to facilitate analysis and monitoring
5. Strong adaptability: the main parameters can be customized to adapt to different market environments
#### Strategy Risk
1. Trend continuation risk: In a strong trending market, reversal strategies may suffer frequent losses.
2. Risk of false breakthrough: High trading volume does not necessarily mean a real market turn
3. Parameter sensitivity: The choice of RSI cycle and overbought and oversold thresholds has a significant impact on strategy performance
4. Impact of slippage: During periods of severe volatility, transaction prices may deviate significantly from expectations.
5. Fund management risk: fixed proportion positions may be too aggressive under certain market conditions
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Trend filtering: Introduce trend judgment indicators to avoid reverse trading during strong trends
2. Dynamic parameters: dynamically adjust the overbought and oversold thresholds of RSI based on market volatility
3. Exit optimization: add stop loss and trailing stop loss mechanisms to improve risk control capabilities
4. Enhanced trading volume analysis: Added trading volume pattern analysis to improve signal quality
5. Time filtering: Add trading time windows to avoid inefficient trading periods
#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete reversal trading system by combining the RSI indicator and volume analysis. The strategy design is reasonable and has good operability and flexibility. There is room for further improvement of the strategy through the suggested optimization directions. When applying in real market, it is recommended to fully test the parameters and carry out targeted optimization based on market characteristics.

#### Overview
This is a contrarian trading strategy based on RSI indicator and volume analysis. The strategy identifies overbought and oversold market conditions, combined with volume confirmation, to take contrary positions when prices reach extreme levels. The core concept is to trade when RSI shows overbought or oversold signals with above-average volume, using RSI midline (50) as exit signals.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy is based on these core components:
1. RSI Calculation: Uses 14-period RSI to monitor price momentum
2. Volume Confirmation: Employs 20-period volume Simple Moving Average (SMA)
3. Entry Logic:
   - Long Entry: When RSI is below 30 (oversold) and volume exceeds its moving average
   - Short Entry: When RSI is above 70 (overbought) and volume exceeds its moving average
4. Exit Logic:
   - Long Exit: RSI crosses above 50
   - Short Exit: RSI crosses below 50

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Systematic Trading Decisions: Establishes objective trading system through clear technical indicator combinations
2. Multiple Confirmation Mechanism: Combines RSI and volume dimensions to improve signal reliability
3. Comprehensive Risk Control: Uses percentage-based money management and prevents pyramiding
4. Visualization Support: Includes complete charting functionality for analysis and monitoring
5. High Adaptability: All major parameters are customizable to adapt to different market conditions

#### Strategy Risks
1. Trend Continuation Risk: Contrarian strategy may experience frequent losses in strong trend markets
2. False Breakout Risk: High volume doesn't necessarily indicate genuine market reversal
3. Parameter Sensitivity: Choice of RSI period and threshold levels significantly impacts strategy performance
4. Slippage Impact: Execution prices may significantly deviate from expected levels during volatile periods
5. Money Management Risk: Fixed percentage position sizing may be too aggressive in certain market conditions

#### Optimization Directions
1. Trend Filtering: Introduce trend identification indicators to avoid counter-trend trading during strong trends
2. Dynamic Parameters: Adjust RSI overbought/oversold thresholds dynamically based on market volatility
3. Exit Enhancement: Add stop-loss and trailing stop mechanisms to improve risk control
4. Volume Analysis Enhancement: Incorporate volume pattern analysis to improve signal quality
5. Time Filtering: Add trading time windows to avoid inefficient trading periods

#### Summary
The strategy constructs a complete contrarian trading system by combining RSI indicator and volume analysis. The strategy design is rational with good operability and flexibility. Through the suggested optimization directions, there is room for further improvement. For live trading implementation, it is recommended to thoroughly test parameters and optimize based on market characteristics.[/trans]

// Trade Logic
//---------------------------

// Long Entry: Look for oversold conditions (RSI < oversold)
//            accompanied by above-average volume (volume > volMA)
// In an uptrend, oversold conditions with high volume may signal a strong reversal opportunity.

// Short Entry: When RSI > overbought and volume is above its moving average,
//              the temporary strength in a downtrend can be exploited contrarily.
shortCondition = (rsiValue > overbought) and (volume > volMA)

// Exit Logic:
// Use a simple RSI midline crossover as an exit trigger.
// For longs, if RSI crosses above 50 (indicating a recovery), exit the long.
// For shorts, if RSI crosses below 50, exit the short.
