### Overview
This strategy combines momentum indicators and trend following to identify strong upward or downward trends in stock prices in the medium term and enter the market at the beginning of the trend. The strategy first calculates the 20-day momentum indicator of the price, and then normalizes it to obtain a normalized momentum value in the range of 0 to 1. Also calculate the 20-day simple moving average as a representative of the mid-term trend. When the normalized momentum is greater than 0.5 and the stock price is above the medium-term trend, go long; when the normalized momentum is less than 0.5 and the stock price is below the medium-term trend, go short.
### Strategy Principles
The core indicator of this strategy is the price's 20-day momentum differential. The momentum difference is defined as: (today's closing price - the closing price 20 days ago) / the closing price 20 days ago. This indicator reflects the price's rise and fall over a 20-day period. In order to avoid the problem of huge price differences between different stocks, the momentum difference is standardized here. The method is: first find the highest and lowest momentum difference in the last 100 days, and then calculate the proportion of the current momentum difference within this range to obtain a standardized momentum value of 0 to 1. Standardization can better reflect the strength of price increases and decreases.
In addition, the strategy also introduces the 20-day simple moving average to determine the direction of the mid-term trend. The moving average is a visually intuitive tool for determining trends. When the price is above the moving average, it is considered to be in an upward trend; when the price is below the moving average, it is in a downward trend.
Combining standardized momentum indicators and mid-term trend judgment, this strategy intends to capture the obvious rise and fall phases of stocks in the mid-term. The specific logic is: if the normalized momentum is greater than 0.5, it means that the stock price is accelerating in the near future; at the same time, the price is higher than the 20-day moving average, which means it is still an upward trend in the mid-term, so go long; on the contrary, if the normalized momentum is less than 0.5, the price is accelerating its decline; at the same time, the price is lower than the 20-day moving average, which means it is also in a downward trend in the mid-term, then go short.
The above is the basic logic of strategic judgment. For entry points, the strategy enters directly when momentum and trend are in the same direction. For stop loss, a fixed minimum stop loss point is set, that is, the highest buying price + the minimum price change unit, and the lowest selling price - the minimum price change unit to prevent invalid floating losses.
### Advantage Analysis
The biggest advantage of this strategy is that it uses two indicators for judgment at the same time, which can effectively filter out some mistaken entry situations. Relying solely on momentum indicators can easily produce false signals, but adding mid-term trend indicators can verify the effectiveness of momentum signals and avoid being trapped in volatile market conditions. Similarly, simply tracking trend indicators will miss some opportunities in the trend, while adding momentum indicators can identify when the trend starts to accelerate. Therefore, the combined use of the two indicators can make the strategy more robust.
Another advantage is that the strategy chooses a 20-day period for calculations. This medium-term parameter setting can reduce the number of high-frequency transactions and help capture medium- and long-term price difference opportunities. At the same time, it can also filter out the impact of short-term market noise.
### Risk Analysis
The main risk with this strategy is that momentum and trend can diverge. When trend and momentum are inconsistent, it creates false signals. For example, if the stock price is in a downward trend but rebounds in the short term, the momentum indicator may produce misleading signals. At this time, if you go long directly, you may suffer losses.
In addition, the stop loss setting of the strategy is relatively simple and cannot completely avoid risks. If there is a sharp gap in the market, the fixed point stop loss may be directly exceeded, which is insufficient to deal with.
### Optimization direction
This strategy has the following main optimization directions:
1. Add more indicators for comprehensive judgment. For example, MACD, KD, Bollinger Bands, etc. This can test the validity of momentum signals and avoid misleading signals.
2. Dynamically adjust the stop loss position. You can set a floating stop loss in real time based on the ATR indicator, or use option pricing theory to calculate a reasonable stop loss line. This can reduce the probability of your stop loss being trapped.
3. Optimize parameter cycle. The current strategy uses a 20-day cycle to calculate the indicator. More parameter combinations can be tested to find the best cycle parameters.
4. Determine the criteria for distinguishing the difference between buying and selling momentum. Currently the same standard of 0.5 is used. The best parameters for buying and selling can be tested separately.
5. Add transaction volume filtering. For example, only send a signal when the volume increases. This can avoid some false breakthroughs with insufficient quantity and energy.
### Summarize
This strategy comprehensively uses trend analysis and momentum indicators to capture trading opportunities brought about by price momentum changes in the medium and long term. Compared with a single indicator, a combination of multiple indicators can improve the accuracy of judgment and profit margins. The stop loss rules are simple and direct, and can quickly stop losses and control risks. If the indicator parameter settings, stop loss methods, and more auxiliary judgment conditions are further optimized, the strategy can be made more flexible and adaptable to different market conditions. Overall, this is a very promising quantitative strategy idea with room for expansion.

### Overview  

This strategy incorporates momentum indicators and trend tracking to identify the mid-term uptrend or downtrend of stock prices and take positions at the beginning stage of trends. The strategy firstly computes the 20-day momentum indicator of price, then processes it into a normalized momentum value ranging from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, the 20-day simple moving average is calculated as a representative of the mid-term trend. When the normalized momentum is larger than 0.5 and the price is above the mid-term trendline, go long. When the normalized momentum is less than 0.5 and the price is below the mid-term trendline, go short.

### Strategy Logic  

The core indicator of this strategy is the 20-day momentum difference of price. The momentum difference is defined as: (today's close – close 20 days ago) / close 20 days ago. This metric reflects the percentage increase or decrease of price over the last 20 days. To solve the issue of vastly different price ranges across stocks, the raw momentum difference is normalized to a 0 to 1 scale by the following process: first find the maximum and minimum values of momentum difference in the past 100 days, then calculate the percentage position of current difference within this range, resulting in a normalized momentum score between 0 and 1. The normalization can better capture the magnitude of price movement.

In addition, the 20-day simple moving average is included to determine the mid-term trend direction. Moving averages are visually intuitive tools for trend analysis. When the price is above the moving average line, it signals an uptrend. When below the line, it indicates a downtrend.   

By combining the normalized momentum indicator and mid-term trend judgment, this strategy aims to capture significant bullish and bearish stages in the mid-term horizon. The logic is: if normalized momentum is larger than 0.5, it means the price is accelerating with an uptrend recently. Meanwhile, if the price stays above 20-day MA, then the mid-term is still an uptrend. Under this condition, go long. On the contrary, if normalized momentum drops below 0.5, it signals an accelerating downtrend recently. Also, with the price below 20-day MA, the mid-term is bearish. Then we should go short.  

The above describes the core decision logic. For entries, the strategy simply enters the market when observing aligned momentum and trend signals. For stop loss, a fixed stop is set at the highest price + minimum tick size for longs, and lowest price - minimum tick size for shorts, in order to prevent inefficient floating losses.

### Advantage Analysis 

The biggest advantage of this strategy is utilizing two indicators for confirmation, which can effectively filter out some false entries in whipsaws. Relying solely on momentum signals tends to produce fake signals occasionally. By adding the condition of mid-term trend, the validity of momentum signals can be verified to avoid being trapped in ranging markets. Similarly, just following the trend may miss some opportunities at the beginning of trend accelerations, while combining momentum can capture such turns in a timely fashion. So the two indicators complement each other to form more robust decisions.  

Another advantage is the choice of 20-day period. This mid-term parameter helps reduce trading frequency compared to faster frequencies, allowing the strategy to capture larger swings over the medium-long term. Meanwhile, it can also filter out short-term market noises.

### Risk Analysis

The major risk of this strategy lies in the divergence between momentum and trend. Misalignments may lead to incorrect signals. For instance, during a downtrend, short-term bounces could push momentum upwards temporarily. If going straight long, it may encounter losses.  

In addition, the stop-loss mechanism is relatively simple and may fail to fully contain risks. In case of huge price gaps, the fixed loss size could be gapped through directly, proving inadequate reaction.

### Optimization Directions   

Here are some major optimization directions for this strategy:

1. Introduce more indicators for cross-examination, such as MACD, KD, Bollinger Bands etc. This can help verify the validity of momentum signals and avoid false signals.  

2. Dynamically adjust stop loss levels, through ATR or options pricing models for example. This may reduce the chance of stops being hit.

3. Optimize parameter periods. The current 20-day parameters can be tested for enhancements.

4. Differentiate buy and sell threshold of momentum difference. Currently 0.5 is used for both. The optimal levels may differ. 

5. Add trading volume filter to avoid false breakouts with insufficient volumes.

### Conclusion   

This strategy combines trend analysis and momentum indicators to capture trading opportunities arising from momentum changes over the medium-long term. Compared to single indicator systems, the multiple indicator approach improves accuracy and profitability. The simple stop mechanism facilitates quick risk control. Further optimizations on parameter tuning, stop-loss techniques and auxiliary conditions can enhance flexibility and adaptiveness to varying market regimes. Overall, it represents a promising quantitative strategy with expansion potential.
