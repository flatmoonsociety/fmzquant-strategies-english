### 1. Overview
This is a low range breakout strategy that combines the RSI indicator and Bollinger Bands. Its main idea is to buy when the RSI is below 10 and sell when the RSI is above 90, with a stop loss line at the 5-period SMA.
### 2. Principle
When the RSI indicator is below 10, it is considered an overbought signal. At this time, the possibility of the stock being overvalued is very small, and it is a better time to buy. When the RSI indicator is above 90, it is considered an oversold signal and is considered a sell signal. The stop loss line is set to a 5-period simple moving average to prevent stop loss due to normal market fluctuations in the short term.
### 3. Advantages
This is a statistical arbitrage strategy that uses indicator signals to buy low and sell high. Its biggest advantage is that by using the RSI indicator to determine buying and selling points, you can effectively seize the opportunity when stocks are overvalued and undervalued and achieve excess profits. At the same time, combining Bollinger Bands to judge interval breakthroughs can avoid the risk of bottoming out and chasing ups and downs.
### 4. Risks and Solutions
The biggest risk of this strategy is that the normal market fluctuations in the short term may exceed the stop loss line, causing unnecessary stop loss. In addition, if the profit is not taken in time, profits may also be missed. The solution is to appropriately adjust the period parameters of the stop loss line to prevent the loss from being stopped due to normal fluctuations. At the same time, you can also set a profit stop line to take the initiative to stop profit after reaching the target profit.
### 5. Optimization direction
This strategy can be optimized through the following aspects:
(1) Adjust the overbought and oversold thresholds of the RSI indicator, such as 15 and 85, to obtain more trading opportunities.
(2) Optimize the period parameters of the stop loss line to adapt to the short-term fluctuations of the market.
(3) Add a take-profit line setting to automatically take profit and control risks.
(4) Optimize parameters by combining volatility indicators, such as adding ATR indicators, etc.
### 6. Summary
The RSI+Bollinger double-track low range breakthrough strategy uses the RSI indicator to determine the buying and selling points, the Bollinger Bands to determine the range, and the SMA as the stop loss line, which can effectively grasp the market, control risks, and achieve stable profits. There is still a lot of room for optimization of this strategy and it deserves further research.

### 1. Overview  

This is a breakout strategy that combines the RSI indicator and Bollinger Bands. The main idea is to buy when RSI is below 10 and sell when RSI is above 90, with the 5 period SMA as the stop loss line.  

### 2. Principles  

When RSI is below 10, it is considered an oversold signal, and the likelihood of overvaluation of the stock is small, so it is a good time to buy. When RSI is above 90, it is considered an overbought signal and a sell signal. The stop loss line is set at the 5 period simple moving average to prevent stop loss due to normal fluctuations in the market in the short term.   

### 3. Advantages   

This is a statistical arbitrage strategy that buys low and sells high using indicator signals. Its biggest advantage is that by judging buy and sell points through the RSI indicator, it can effectively seize the timing of stock overvaluation and undervaluation to achieve excess returns. At the same time, combined with breakout judgments of Bollinger Bands, it avoids the risks of catching a falling knife and chasing tops and bottoms.  

### 4. Risks and Solutions  

The biggest risk of this strategy is that normal fluctuations in the market in the short term may exceed the stop loss line, causing unnecessary stop loss. In addition, failure to take profits in time may also miss profits. Solutions are to appropriately adjust the cycle parameters of the stop loss line to prevent normal fluctuations from being stopped out. At the same time, a take profit line can also be set to take profits proactively after reaching the target return.  

### 5. Optimization Directions  

This strategy can be optimized in the following aspects:  

(1) Adjust the overbought and oversold threshold values of the RSI indicator, such as 15 and 85, to obtain more trading opportunities.  

(2) Optimize the cycle parameters of the stop loss line to adapt to short-term fluctuations in the market.  

(3) Add settings for take profit lines for automatic profit taking and risk control.  

(4) Combine volatility indicators to optimize parameters, such as adding ATR indicators.   

### 6. Summary   

The RSI+Bollinger Bands breakout strategy at lower area uses RSI to determine entry and exit points, Bollinger Bands to determine range, and SMA as stop loss line, which can effectively capture trends, control risks, and achieve steady profits. There is still much room for optimization of this strategy and it is worth further research.
