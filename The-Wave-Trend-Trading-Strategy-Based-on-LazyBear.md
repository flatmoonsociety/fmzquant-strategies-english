## Overview
This is a trading strategy based on LazyBear’s Wave Trend Indicator. This strategy calculates the wave trend of price fluctuations, determines the overbought and oversold conditions of the market, and performs longing and shorting.
## Strategy Principle
This strategy is primarily based on LazyBear’s Wave Trend indicator. First calculate the average price (AP), then calculate the exponential moving average of AP (ESA) and the exponential moving average of absolute price changes (D). Based on this, the volatility index (CI) is calculated, and then the exponential moving average of CI is calculated to obtain the wave trend line (WT). WT is then used to generate WT1 and WT2 through a simple moving average. When WT1 crosses WT2 above, it is a golden cross, go long; when WT1 crosses below WT2, it is a death cross, go short.
## Advantage Analysis
This is a very simple but very practical trend following strategy. The main advantages are:
1. Based on the wave trend indicator, price trends and market sentiment can be clearly identified
2. Use the golden cross and death cross of WT to determine the long and short points. The operation is simple.
3. Customizable parameters can be used to adjust the sensitivity of the WT line to adapt to different cycles.
4. Further conditions can be added to filter signals, such as limiting the trading time window
## Risk Analysis
There are also some risks with this strategy:
1. As a trend following strategy, it is easy to generate a large number of false signals in a consolidating market.
2. The WT line itself has strong hysteresis and may miss the rapid turning point of price.
3. The default parameters may not be suitable for all varieties and periods and need to be optimized.
4. There is no stop loss mechanism, and one-way position holding time may be too long.
The main solutions are:
1. Optimize parameters and adjust the sensitivity of WT line
2. Add other indicators for verification to avoid false signals
3. Set stop loss and take profit
4. Limit the number of transactions or positions per day
## Optimization direction
There is room for further optimization of this strategy:
1. Optimize the parameters of WT to make it more sensitive or stable
2. Use different parameter combinations based on different periods
3. Add volume price indicators, volatility indicators, etc. as confirmation signals
4. Add stop loss and take profit logic
5. Enrich position holding methods, such as pyramid position addition, grid trading, etc.
6. Combine machine learning and other methods to mine better features and trading rules
## Summarize
This strategy is a very simple and practical wave trend following strategy. It calculates the price fluctuation trend, identifies the overbought and oversold state of the market, and uses the golden cross and death cross of the WT line to send trading signals. The strategy is simple to operate and easy to implement. However, as a trend strategy, its sensitivity and stability of stock prices need to be further optimized, and it also needs to be coordinated with other indicators and logic to avoid false signals. Overall, this is a very practical strategy template with a lot of room for optimization.

## Overview

This is a trading strategy based on LazyBear's Wave Trend indicator. The strategy identifies market sentiment through computing the wave trend of price fluctuations, and makes long and short decisions accordingly.  

## Strategy Logic

The core of this strategy is LazyBear's Wave Trend indicator. It first calculates the average price (AP), then the exponential moving average of AP (ESA) and the absolute price movement (D). Based on ESA and D the strategy calculates the Volatility Index (CI), which then feeds into an exponential moving average to generate the Wave Trend line (WT). WT is further processed into WT1 and WT2 using simple moving averages. When WT1 crosses over WT2, it triggers the golden cross and goes long. When WT1 crosses below WT2, it triggers the death cross and goes short.

## Advantage Analysis  

This is a very simple but practical trend following strategy. The main advantages are:

1. It identifies price trend and market sentiment clearly based on the Wave Trend indicator  
2. Simple trading logic of going long/short based on golden/death crosses of WT lines
3. Customizable parameters to adjust sensitivity of WT for different cycles  
4. Flexibility to add further filters such as trading time window

## Risk Analysis   

There are some risks to this strategy:

1. As a trend following strategy, it can generate many false signals during range-bound markets
2. The lagging nature of WT may cause missed turns   
3. Default parameters may not suit all products and cycles
4. No stop loss mechanism, holding period can be very long

The main solutions are:

1. Optimize parameters to tune sensitivity of WT
2. Add other indicators for confirmation to avoid false signals
3. Employ stop loss and take profit  
4. Limit daily trades or positions 

## Optimization Directions

There is room for further optimization:

1. Optimize WT parameters for better sensitivity or stability
2. Use different parameter sets based on cycles
3. Add indicators like volume, volatility for confirmation   
4. Add stop loss and take profit
5. Enrich trading logic like pyramiding, grid trading
6. Explore better features and rules using machine learning

## Summary

In summary, this is a very simple and practical wave trend following strategy. By modeling the wave trend of price fluctuations, it identifies overbought and oversold market conditions to generate trade signals using WT's golden crosses and death crosses. The strategy is easy to implement but may require further optimization for sensitivity and stability. As a trend following strategy, it also needs additional filters and logic to avoid false signals. Overall this serves as a useful strategy template with lots of room for improvements.
