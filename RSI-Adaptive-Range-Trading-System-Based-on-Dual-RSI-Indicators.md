#### Overview
This strategy is an adaptive trading system based on the dual RSI (relative strength index) indicator. It combines RSI indicators of different time periods to identify market trends and trading opportunities, and optimizes trading performance through fund management and risk control mechanisms. The core of this strategy is to improve profitability while ensuring transaction security through the coordination of multi-period RSI.
#### Strategy Principle
The strategy uses the 7-period RSI indicator as the main trading signal, and combines the daily RSI as a trend filter. When the short-term RSI breaks upward from below 40 and the daily RSI is greater than 55, the system will issue a long signal. If the price drops below the initial position opening price during the position period, the system will automatically increase the position to reduce the average cost. When the RSI breaks downward from above 60, the system closes the position and makes a profit. At the same time, a 5% stop loss was set to control risks. The strategy also includes a fund management module that automatically calculates the position size of each transaction based on the total funds and a preset risk ratio.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Multi-cycle RSI cooperation improves signal reliability
2. It has an adaptive position-adding mechanism that can effectively reduce the cost of holding positions.
3. Complete fund management system that automatically adjusts positions according to risk preferences
4. Fixed stop loss protection to strictly control the risk of each transaction
5. Taking into account transaction costs, it is more in line with the actual trading environment
#### Strategy Risk
1. The RSI indicator may generate false signals in volatile markets
2. The position-adding mechanism may lead to larger losses in a continued falling market.
3. Fixed percentage stops may be too conservative during periods of high volatility
4. Transaction costs may significantly affect returns when trading frequently
5. Sufficient liquidity is needed to support strategy execution
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce volatility indicators (such as ATR) to dynamically adjust stop loss positions
2. Add trend strength filter to reduce false signals in volatile markets
3. Optimize the logic of adding positions and make dynamic adjustments considering market volatility.
4. Add more time periods of RSI confirmation signals
5. Develop an adaptive warehouse management system
#### Summary
This is a complete trading system that combines technical analysis and risk management. Trading signals are provided through the synergy of multi-period RSI, and risks are controlled through fund management and stop-loss mechanisms. This strategy is suitable for operating in markets with obvious trends, but it requires parameter optimization based on actual market conditions. The system has good scalability and leaves room for further optimization. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is an adaptive trading system based on dual RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicators. It combines RSI indicators from different timeframes to identify market trends and trading opportunities while optimizing trading performance through money management and risk control mechanisms. The core strength of the strategy lies in the synergy between multi-period RSIs to enhance profitability while maintaining trading safety.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy uses a 7-period RSI indicator as the primary trading signal, combined with a daily RSI as a trend filter. A long position is initiated when the short-period RSI breaks above 40 and the daily RSI is above 55. If the price drops below the initial entry price during a position, the system automatically adds to the position to lower the average cost. Positions are closed when RSI breaks below from above 60. A 5% stop-loss is implemented for risk control. The strategy also includes a money management module that automatically calculates position sizes based on total capital and preset risk ratios.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Multi-period RSI combination improves signal reliability
2. Adaptive position averaging mechanism effectively reduces holding costs
3. Comprehensive money management system adjusts positions based on risk preference
4. Fixed stop-loss protection strictly controls risk per trade
5. Considers trading costs for more realistic trading conditions

#### Strategy Risks
1. RSI indicators may generate false signals in volatile markets
2. Position averaging mechanism may lead to significant losses in continuous downtrends
3. Fixed percentage stop-loss may be too conservative in high volatility periods
4. Trading costs can significantly impact returns during frequent trading
5. Strategy execution requires sufficient liquidity

#### Optimization Directions
1. Incorporate volatility indicators (like ATR) for dynamic stop-loss adjustment
2. Add trend strength filters to reduce false signals in ranging markets
3. Optimize position averaging logic with dynamic adjustments based on market volatility
4. Include RSI confirmations from additional timeframes
5. Develop adaptive position sizing system

#### Summary
This is a complete trading system combining technical analysis and risk management. It generates trading signals through multi-period RSI coordination while controlling risk through money management and stop-loss mechanisms. The strategy is suitable for trending markets but requires parameter optimization based on actual market conditions. The system's good extensibility leaves room for further optimization.[/trans]
