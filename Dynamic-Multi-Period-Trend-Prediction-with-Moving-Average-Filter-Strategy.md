#### Overview
This strategy is a trend following system that combines traditional technical analysis with modern artificial intelligence methods. It mainly uses exponential moving averages (EMA) and simple moving averages (SMA) as trend filters, while introducing prediction models to optimize entry opportunities. The strategy is optimized specifically for the daily level and is designed to capture mid- to long-term market trends.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of a strategy consists of three main components:
1. Trend judgment system - Use the 200-period EMA and SMA as the main trend filters to determine the current trend direction through the position relationship between the price and the moving average.
2. Prediction module - using scalable prediction components, currently using simulation prediction, which can be replaced with a machine learning model in the future
3. Position management - Set fixed 4 K-line position periods to control position time and risk
The generation of trading signals needs to meet the consistency of trend direction and prediction signals at the same time, that is:
- Bull signal: price is above EMA and SMA, and forecast value is positive
- Bear signal: price is below EMA and SMA, and the predicted value is negative
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Clear structure - the strategy logic is simple and intuitive, easy to understand and maintain
2. Risk controllable - effectively control risk through fixed position period and dual moving average filtering
3. Strong scalability - the prediction module is flexible in design and can be connected to different prediction models according to needs
4. Good adaptability - parameters can be adjusted to adapt to different market environments
5. Moderate operating frequency - daily-level operations reduce transaction costs and psychological pressure
#### Strategy Risk
1. Trend reversal risk - continuous losses may occur at trend turning points
2. Parameter sensitivity - the choice of moving average period and position period has a greater impact on strategy performance
3. Model dependence - the accuracy of the prediction module directly affects the strategy effect
4. Impact of slippage - Daily level operations may face larger slippage
5. Market environment dependence - may perform poorly in volatile markets
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Prediction model upgrade - introduce machine learning models to replace existing random predictions
2. Dynamic holding period - dynamically adjust the holding time according to market volatility
3. Stop loss optimization - add a dynamic stop loss mechanism to improve risk control capabilities
4. Position Management - Introducing a volatility-based position management system
5. Multi-dimensional filtering - adding auxiliary indicators such as trading volume and volatility
#### Summary
This strategy builds a robust trend following system by combining traditional technical analysis with modern forecasting methods. Its main advantages are clear logic, controllable risks and strong scalability. Through strategy optimization, especially improvements in prediction models and risk control, it is expected to further improve the stability and profitability of the strategy. The strategy is suitable for investors who pursue medium- to long-term stable returns. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is a trend following system that combines traditional technical analysis with modern artificial intelligence methods. It primarily uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) as trend filters, while incorporating a prediction model to optimize entry timing. The strategy is specifically optimized for daily timeframes, aiming to capture medium to long-term market trends.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic consists of three main components:
1. Trend Determination System - Uses 200-period EMA and SMA as primary trend filters, determining current trend direction through price-to-moving average relationships
2. Prediction Module - Employs an expandable prediction component, currently using simulated predictions, with the capability to be replaced by machine learning models
3. Position Management - Sets a fixed 4-bar holding period to control position duration and risk

Trade signals require consistency between trend direction and prediction signals:
- Long signals: Price above both EMA and SMA, with positive prediction value
- Short signals: Price below both EMA and SMA, with negative prediction value

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Clear Structure - Simple and intuitive strategy logic, easy to understand and maintain
2. Controlled Risk - Effective risk control through fixed holding periods and dual moving average filters
3. High Scalability - Flexible prediction module design, capable of integrating different prediction models
4. Good Adaptability - Adjustable parameters to adapt to different market environments
5. Moderate Trading Frequency - Daily timeframe operations reduce trading costs and psychological pressure

#### Strategy Risks
1. Trend Reversal Risk - Potential consecutive losses at trend turning points
2. Parameter Sensitivity - Moving average and holding period selections significantly impact strategy performance
3. Model Dependency - Prediction module accuracy directly affects strategy effectiveness
4. Slippage Impact - Daily timeframe operations may face significant slippage
5. Market Environment Dependency - May underperform in ranging markets

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Prediction Model Upgrade - Introduce machine learning models to replace existing random predictions
2. Dynamic Holding Period - Adjust holding time based on market volatility
3. Stop-Loss Optimization - Add dynamic stop-loss mechanisms to improve risk control
4. Position Management - Introduce volatility-based position management system
5. Multi-dimensional Filtering - Add volume, volatility, and other auxiliary indicators

#### Summary
This strategy builds a robust trend following system by combining traditional technical analysis with modern prediction methods. Its main advantages lie in clear logic, controlled risk, and strong scalability. Through strategy optimization, particularly in prediction models and risk control improvements, it has the potential to further enhance stability and profitability. The strategy is suitable for investors seeking medium to long-term stable returns.[/trans]
