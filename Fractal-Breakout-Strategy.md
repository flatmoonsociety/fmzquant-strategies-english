## Overview
This strategy is a long-term trend following strategy for determining price trends. It determines the opening of a position by calculating the fractal points of historical prices and judging the breakthrough of the last fractal point. At the same time, it determines the trend direction by calculating the average price of the last N fractal points, and closes the position when the trend turns.
## Strategy Principle
1. Calculate the fractal point of the price. A fractal point is defined as when the highest price of the day is higher than the highest price of the two days before and the next two days.
2. Record the price of the last fractal point as resistance.
3. When the closing price breaks through the last fractal point, it is considered that the resistance has been broken through and a long position is established.
4. Calculate the average price of the last N fractal points to determine the trend. When the average price rises, it is a bullish trend, and when it falls, it is a bearish trend.
5. If the average fractal point price turns downward when taking a long position, close the position.
## Advantage Analysis
The biggest advantage of this strategy of judging trends based on fractal points is that it can effectively filter market noise and determine the longer-term trend direction. Compared with indicators such as simple moving averages, it is more resistant to sudden abnormal fluctuations.
In addition, this strategy has very clear criteria for judging the opening and closing of positions, and there will be no problem of frequent transactions. This also makes it particularly suitable for long-term holding.
## Risk Analysis
The biggest risk of this strategy lies in the probabilistic nature of the judgment of the fractal point itself. Fractal points cannot predict 100% that the price will inevitably reverse, which means that the probability of wrong judgment still exists. When a misjudgment occurs, you will face the risk of loss.
In addition, the time span for fractal point judgment is long and cannot be adapted to high-frequency trading. If you are pursuing short-term trading, this strategy is not suitable.
## Optimization direction
Considering the error probability of fractal point judgment, we can optimize it through the following methods:
1. Confirm with other indicators, such as Bollinger Bands channel, moving average, etc., to avoid errors in judgment of a single fractal point.
2. Adjust the parameters of fractal points, such as the number of periods before and after the judgment, to optimize the judgment of fractal points.
3. Add a stop loss strategy to stop the loss when the loss expands to a certain extent.
## Summarize
Overall, this breakthrough fractal strategy is very suitable for judging long-term trends and is also very suitable for long-term investors. We only need to appropriately adjust parameters and add other filtering indicators on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of judgment, so that we can greatly optimize this strategy and make it an important part of quantitative decision.

## Overview  

This is a trend-following long line tracking strategy that judges the trend based on price fractals. It decides to open positions based on the breakthrough of the latest fractal point. At the same time, it judges the trend direction by calculating the average price of the last N fractal points and closes positions when the trend changes.

## Principles  

1. Calculate the fractal points of prices. The fractal point is defined as the highest price today that is higher than the highest prices of the previous two days and the next two days.

2. Record the price of the last fractal point as resistance.  

3. When the closing price breaks through the last fractal point, it is considered that the resistance has been broken and a long position has been established.

4. Calculate the average price of the last N fractal points to determine the trend. When the average price rises, it is a bullish trend, and when it falls, it is a bearish trend.  

5. If the average fractal point price turns down during the long position, close the position.

## Advantage Analysis   

The biggest advantage of this fractal-based trend judgment strategy is that it can effectively filter market noise and determine longer-term trend directions. Compared with simple moving average lines and other indicators, it has greater resistance to sudden abnormal fluctuations.

In addition, the criteria for opening and closing positions of this strategy are very clear, which avoids frequent trading. It also makes it particularly suitable for long-term holdings.  

## Risk Analysis

The biggest risk of this strategy lies in the probabilistic nature of the fractal points themselves. Fractals cannot fully predict whether prices will definitely reverse, that is, the probability of misjudgment still exists. When misjudgments occur, it will face the risk of losses.

In addition, the time span for judging fractal points is long and cannot adapt to high frequency trading. If you pursue short-term trading, this strategy may not be suitable.

## Optimization Directions  

Considering the probability of misjudgment of fractal points, we can optimize in the following ways:

1. Combine with other indicators such as Bollinger Bands, moving averages, etc. to avoid misjudgments based solely on fractal points.  

2. Adjust the parameters of fractal points, such as the number of periods before and after judgment, to optimize fractal point judgments.

3. Add stop loss strategies to stop losses when losses expand to a certain extent.   

## Summary  

The Fractal Breakout Strategy is very suitable for judging long-term trends overall and is very suitable for use by long-term investors. As long as we properly adjust the parameters appropriately, add other filtering indicators on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of judgment, we can greatly optimize this strategy and make it an important part of quantitative Decision.

// ChartArt's Fractal Breakout Strategy
//
// Version 1.0
// Idea by ChartArt on April 24, 2016.
//
// This long only strategy determines the last fractal top
// and enters a trade when the price breaks above the last
// fractal top. The strategy also calculates the average
// price of the last 2 (or 3) fractal tops to get the trend.
//
// The strategy exits the long trade when the average of the
// fractal tops is falling (when the trend is lower highs).
// And the user can manually set a delay of this exit.
//
// In addition the fractals tops can be colored in blue
// and a line can be drawn based on the fractal tops.
// This fractal top line is colored by the fractal trend.
