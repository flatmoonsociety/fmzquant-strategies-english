This strategy is a cross-market overnight holding strategy based on EMA technical indicators, designed to capture trading opportunities before the market closes and after the market opens. The strategy realizes intelligent trading in different market environments through precise time control and technical indicator filtering.
#### Strategy Overview
The strategy mainly earns profits by entering the market at a specific time before the market closes and exiting at a specific time after the market opens the next day. Use the EMA indicator as trend confirmation to find trading opportunities in multiple global markets. The strategy also integrates automated trading functions to enable unattended operations.
#### Strategy Principle
1. Time control: According to the trading hours of different markets, enter the market at a fixed time before the market closes and exit at a fixed time after the market opens.
2. EMA filtering: Use the optional EMA indicator to verify entry signals
3. Market selection: Supports adaptive trading time in the three major markets of the United States, Asia, and Europe
4. Weekend protection: Forced liquidation of positions before the close on Friday to avoid the risk of holding positions over the weekend
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Multi-market adaptability: trading hours can be flexibly adjusted according to different market characteristics
2. Improved risk control: including weekend closing protection mechanism
3. High degree of automation: supports automatic transaction interface docking
4. Flexible and adjustable parameters: trading time and technical indicator parameters can be customized
5. Transaction cost considerations: including handling fees and slippage settings
#### Strategy Risk
1. Market fluctuation risk: overnight positions may face gap risk
2. Time dependence: The effect of the strategy is affected by the choice of market time period
3. Technical indicator limitations: a single EMA indicator may lag
Suggestion: Set stop loss limits and add more technical indicator verifications
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Add more technical indicator combinations
2. Introduce volatility filtering mechanism
3. Optimize the selection of entry and exit times
4. Add adaptive parameter adjustment function
5. Enhance risk control module
#### Summary
This strategy implements a reliable overnight trading system through precise time control and technical indicator filtering. The strategy design fully considers actual combat needs, including multi-market adaptation, risk control, automated trading and other elements, and has strong practical value. Through continuous optimization and improvement, this strategy is expected to achieve stable returns in real trading.

// This strategy, titled "Overnight Market Entry Strategy with EMA Filter," is designed for entering long positions shortly before 
// the market closes and exiting shortly after the market opens. The strategy allows for selecting between different global market sessions (US, Asia, Europe) and 
// uses an optional EMA (Exponential Moving Average) filter to validate entry signals. The core logic is to enter trades based on conditions set for a specified period before 
// the market close and to exit trades either after a specified period following the market open or just before the weekend close. 
// Additionally, 3commas bot integration is included to automate the execution of trades. The strategy dynamically adjusts to market open and close times, ensuring trades are properly timed based on the selected market. 
// It also includes a force-close mechanism on Fridays to prevent holding positions over the weekend.
