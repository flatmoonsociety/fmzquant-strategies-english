#### Overview
This strategy is a trend following system that combines multiple moving averages and the Balance of Volume indicator (OBV). This strategy uses the synergy of the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA), 20-day weighted moving average (WMA), and 200-day weighted moving average to determine market trends, while combining it with the OBV indicator to confirm volume support to find more reliable trading signals.
#### Strategy Principle
The strategy operates based on two core conditions:
1. Trend confirmation conditions: It is required that the 9-day EMA, 20-day WMA and 200-day WMA are all in an upward trend (the current value is greater than the previous period's value). This multi-time frame trend confirmation method can effectively filter out false breakthroughs.
2. Trading volume confirmation conditions: use the OBV indicator and its 13-period EMA. When the 13-period EMA of OBV is above OBV, it indicates that volume supports the current price trend.
Only when these two conditions are met at the same time, the strategy will send a long signal. When the conditions are no longer met, the strategy will close the position and leave the market.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Multiple confirmation mechanism: It combines double confirmation of price trends and trading volume trends to improve the reliability of signals.
2. Strong adaptability: By using moving averages of different periods, the strategy can adapt to different market environments.
3. Improved risk control: The strategy adopts percentage position management and sets reasonable commission considerations.
4. Clear visualization: Contains a complete graphical display system to facilitate traders to understand market conditions.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Lagging risk: Moving averages are essentially lagging indicators and may react slowly in violently volatile markets.
2. Risk of market shock: In a volatile market, frequent false signals may occur.
3. Fund management risk: Fixed percentage position management may not be flexible enough under certain market conditions.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introducing dynamic stop loss: Dynamic stop loss can be set based on ATR or volatility.
2. Optimize position management: Introduce a dynamic position management system based on volatility.
3. Add market environment filtering: Add a market environment identification mechanism to adjust strategy parameters under different market conditions.
4. Optimize entry timing: You can optimize entry points by adding momentum indicators such as RSI.
#### Summary
This strategy builds a relatively complete trend following trading system by combining multiple moving averages and trading volume analysis. The core advantage of the strategy lies in its multiple confirmation mechanism, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the inherent hysteresis problem of the moving average. There is room for further improvement of the strategy through the suggested optimization directions. ||

#### Overview
This strategy is a trend following system that combines multiple moving averages with the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator. It utilizes the synergy of 9-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), 20-day Weighted Moving Average (WMA), and 200-day WMA to determine market trends, while incorporating OBV to confirm volume support for more reliable trading signals.

#### Strategy Principle
The strategy operates based on two core conditions:
1. Trend Confirmation: Requires 9-day EMA, 20-day WMA, and 200-day WMA to be in upward trends (current value greater than previous). This multi-timeframe trend confirmation method effectively filters out false breakouts.
2. Volume Confirmation: Uses OBV and its 13-period EMA. When the 13-period EMA of OBV is above the OBV line, it indicates volume supports the current price movement.

Long positions are only taken when both conditions are simultaneously met. Positions are closed when conditions are no longer satisfied.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Multiple Confirmation Mechanism: Combines price trend and volume trend confirmation, increasing signal reliability.
2. Strong Adaptability: Through the use of different period moving averages, the strategy can adapt to various market environments.
3. Comprehensive Risk Control: Implements percentage-based position management with reasonable commission consideration.
4. Clear Visualization: Includes a complete graphical display system for better market condition understanding.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Lag Risk: Moving averages are inherently lagging indicators, potentially responding slowly in volatile markets.
2. Sideways Market Risk: May generate frequent false signals in range-bound markets.
3. Money Management Risk: Fixed percentage position sizing might not be flexible enough under certain market conditions.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Implement Dynamic Stop-Loss: Can introduce ATR or volatility-based dynamic stop-loss levels.
2. Optimize Position Management: Introduce volatility-based dynamic position sizing system.
3. Add Market Environment Filters: Incorporate market regime identification mechanisms to adjust strategy parameters under different market conditions.
4. Optimize Entry Timing: Can add momentum indicators like RSI to optimize entry points.

#### Summary
The strategy constructs a relatively complete trend following trading system by combining multiple moving averages and volume analysis. Its core strength lies in its multiple confirmation mechanism, while attention needs to be paid to the inherent lag in moving averages. Through the suggested optimization directions, there is room for further strategy enhancement.
