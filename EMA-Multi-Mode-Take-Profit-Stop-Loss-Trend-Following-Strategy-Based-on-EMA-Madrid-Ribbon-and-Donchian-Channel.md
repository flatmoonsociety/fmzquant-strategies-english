#### Overview
This is a trend following strategy that combines the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Madrid Ribbon, and Donchian Channel. The uniqueness of the strategy is that it provides three switchable stop-profit and stop-loss modes: based on points, based on amount and based on risk-return ratio. The reliability of transactions is improved through the secondary signal confirmation mechanism, and transactions are only conducted when a valid signal appears for the second time.
#### Strategy Principle
The strategy uses a triple combination of technical indicators to identify trading opportunities:
1. The 200-period exponential moving average is used to determine the overall trend direction
2. Madrid Band (the intersection of 5-period and 100-period EMA) is used to determine the mid-term trend
3. Donchian channel breakthrough is used to find specific entry opportunities.
Bullish trading conditions: price above the 200EMA, Madrid Band turning bullish and price breaking above the upper Donchian Channel.
Short trading conditions: price below the 200 EMA, the Madrid Band turns bearish and the price breaks out of the lower Donchian Channel.
To reduce false signals, the strategy only executes the trade the second time a valid signal occurs.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Flexible stop-profit and stop-loss management system that can switch modes according to different trading styles
2. The combination of multiple technical indicators provides more reliable trading signals
3. The secondary confirmation mechanism effectively reduces the impact of false signals.
4. The strategy completely avoids look-ahead bias and there is no redrawing problem.
5. Highly customizable to adapt to different market environments
#### Strategy Risk
1. A large retracement may occur when the trend reverses
Solution: Improve strategy sensitivity by adjusting indicator parameters
2. Over-reliance on technical indicators may miss certain market opportunities
Solution: It is recommended to combine fundamental analysis
3. Fixed take-profit and stop-loss may not be suitable for all market conditions
Solution: Dynamically adjust take profit and stop loss levels based on volatility
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce volatility indicators to dynamically adjust take-profit and stop-loss levels
2. Add transaction volume analysis to improve signal reliability
3. Add more market sentiment indicators
4. Develop adaptive parameter optimization system
5. Add risk management modules, such as maximum drawdown control
#### Summary
This is a trend following strategy that combines multiple classic technical indicators, and improves the stability of transactions through flexible stop-profit and stop-loss management and secondary confirmation mechanisms. The strategy's high degree of customizability allows it to be adapted to different market environments and trading styles. It is recommended to conduct sufficient historical data backtesting before using the real offer, and adjust parameter settings according to specific market characteristics. ||
#### Overview
This is a trend following strategy that combines Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Madrid Ribbon, and Donchian Channel. The strategy's uniqueness lies in its three switchable take-profit/stop-loss modes: tick-based, dollar-based, and risk-reward ratio based. It enhances reliability through a double confirmation mechanism, only executing trades on the second valid signal.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy employs a triple technical indicator combination to identify trading opportunities:
1. 200-period EMA to determine overall trend direction
2. Madrid Ribbon (crossover of 5-period and 100-period EMA) for medium-term trend judgment
3. Donchian Channel breakout for specific entry timing

Long trade conditions: price above 200 EMA, bullish Madrid Ribbon, and price breaks above Donchian Channel.
Short trade conditions: price below 200 EMA, bearish Madrid Ribbon, and price breaks below Donchian Channel.
To reduce false signals, trades are only executed on the second valid signal occurrence.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Flexible TP/SL management system adaptable to different trading styles
2. Multiple technical indicators combination provides more reliable signals
3. Double confirmation mechanism effectively reduces false signals
4. Strategy completely avoids look-ahead bias with no repainting
5. Highly customizable for different market environments

#### Strategy Risks
1. Potential significant drawdowns during trend reversals
Solution: Adjust indicator parameters to increase strategy sensitivity
2. Over-reliance on technical indicators may miss certain market opportunities
Solution: Recommend combining with fundamental analysis
3. Fixed TP/SL may not suit all market conditions
Solution: Dynamically adjust TP/SL levels based on volatility

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce volatility indicators for dynamic TP/SL adjustment
2. Add volume analysis to improve signal reliability
3. Incorporate more market sentiment indicators
4. Develop adaptive parameter optimization system
5. Add risk management module, such as maximum drawdown control

#### Summary
This is a trend following strategy that combines multiple classic technical indicators, enhancing trading stability through flexible TP/SL management and double confirmation mechanism. The strategy's high customizability allows it to adapt to different market environments and trading styles. It is recommended to conduct thorough historical data backtesting before live trading and adjust parameters according to specific market characteristics.[/trans]
