#### Overview
This is a fully automated intraday momentum-based trading strategy that combines rigorous risk management with a precise position management system. This strategy mainly operates during the London trading session, looking for trading opportunities by identifying changes in market momentum and excluding Doji patterns, while implementing daily take-profit rules to control risk. The strategy adopts a dynamic position management method and automatically adjusts the transaction size according to the account equity to ensure the optimal use of funds.
#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of a strategy is built on several key components. First, trading hours are limited to London hours (excluding times after 0:00 and 19:00) to ensure sufficient market liquidity. The entry signal is based on the breakthrough of price momentum, which specifically requires that the high point of the current candle line breaks through the high point of the previous one (long) or the low point breaks through the low point of the previous candle (short), and it also needs to meet the direction consistency requirements. To avoid false breakouts, the strategy explicitly excludes Doji candles. The strategy also implements a daily take-profit rule. Once the target profit is reached, no new positions will be opened that day.
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Comprehensive risk management: including fixed stop-loss and take-profit, daily take-profit rules and dynamic position management
2. Strong adaptability: the transaction size is automatically adjusted according to the account equity, adapting to different fund sizes
3. Liquidity guarantee: Strictly restrict the execution of transactions during London trading hours to avoid low liquidity risks
4. False signal filtering: Reduce losses caused by false breakthroughs by excluding Doji patterns and continuous signals
5. Clear execution logic: clear entry and exit conditions for easy monitoring and optimization
#### Strategy Risk
1. Market volatility risk: During periods of high volatility, fixed stops may not be flexible enough
2. Price slippage risk: You may face large slippage when the market fluctuates rapidly.
3. Trend dependence: The strategy may produce more false signals in volatile markets
4. Parameter sensitivity: Stop loss and take profit settings have a greater impact on strategy performance
Solutions include: adopting dynamic stop-loss mechanisms, adding market volatility filters, introducing trend confirmation indicators, etc.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introduce an adaptive stop loss mechanism: dynamically adjust the stop loss range based on ATR or volatility
2. Add market environment filtering: add trend strength indicator and increase the holding time when the trend is clear.
3. Optimize the signal confirmation mechanism: combine trading volume and other technical indicators to improve signal reliability
4. Improve fund management: introduce a compound risk management system and consider drawdown control
5. Add market microstructure analysis: integrate order flow data to improve entry accuracy
#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete trading framework by combining momentum breakouts, rigorous risk management, and an automated execution system. The main advantage of the strategy lies in its comprehensive risk control system and adaptive design, but it still needs to be optimized in terms of market environment identification and signal filtering. Through continuous improvement and parameter optimization, this strategy is expected to maintain stable performance in different market environments.

#### Overview
This is a fully automated trading strategy based on intraday momentum, incorporating strict risk management and precise position sizing systems. The strategy operates primarily during London trading hours, seeking trading opportunities through momentum change identification and Doji pattern exclusion, while implementing daily take-profit rules for risk control. The strategy employs dynamic position management, automatically adjusting trading size based on account equity to optimize capital utilization.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic is built on several key components. First, trading is restricted to London hours (excluding 0:00 and after 19:00) to ensure adequate market liquidity. Entry signals are based on price momentum breakouts, specifically requiring the current candle's high to break above the previous candle's high (for longs) or the low to break below the previous candle's low (for shorts), while maintaining directional consistency. To avoid false breakouts, the strategy explicitly excludes Doji candles. The strategy also implements a daily take-profit rule, ceasing new positions once the target profit is achieved.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Comprehensive Risk Management: Includes fixed stop-loss/take-profit, daily profit targets, and dynamic position sizing
2. Strong Adaptability: Trading size automatically adjusts based on account equity, suitable for different capital scales
3. Liquidity Assurance: Strict trading execution during London hours to avoid low liquidity risks
4. False Signal Filtering: Reduces losses from false breakouts by excluding Doji patterns and consecutive signals
5. Clear Execution Logic: Well-defined entry and exit conditions for easy monitoring and optimization

#### Strategy Risks
1. Market Volatility Risk: Fixed stop-loss may lack flexibility during high volatility periods
2. Price Slippage Risk: May face significant slippage during rapid market movements
3. Trend Dependency: Strategy may generate false signals in ranging markets
4. Parameter Sensitivity: Strategy performance heavily influenced by stop-loss/take-profit settings
Solutions include: implementing dynamic stop-loss mechanisms, adding volatility filters, and incorporating trend confirmation indicators.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce Adaptive Stop-Loss: Dynamically adjust stop-loss ranges based on ATR or volatility
2. Add Market Environment Filtering: Incorporate trend strength indicators to extend holding periods in clear trends
3. Optimize Signal Confirmation: Enhance signal reliability by integrating volume and other technical indicators
4. Improve Capital Management: Introduce compound risk management systems considering drawdown control
5. Enhance Market Microstructure Analysis: Integrate order flow data for more precise entries

#### Summary
The strategy builds a comprehensive trading framework by combining momentum breakouts, strict risk management, and automated execution systems. Its main strengths lie in its comprehensive risk control system and adaptive design, though improvements in market environment recognition and signal filtering are needed. Through continuous improvement and parameter optimization, the strategy shows potential for maintaining stable performance across different market conditions.[/trans]
