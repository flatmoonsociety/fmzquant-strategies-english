#### Overview
This strategy is a trading system that combines double moving average crossover signals with dynamic risk management. Trading signals are generated through the intersection of short-term and long-term moving averages, while the ATR indicator is used to dynamically adjust stop loss and profit points, and time filters and cooling periods are introduced to optimize transaction quality. The strategy also incorporates mechanisms for managing risk-to-reward ratios and risk percentages on each trade.
#### Strategy Principle
The strategy is mainly based on the following core components:
1. The signal generation system uses the intersection of short-term (10-period) and long-term (100-period) simple moving averages to trigger trades. When the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average upward, a long signal is generated, and vice versa, a short signal is generated.
2. The risk management system uses the 14-period ATR multiplied by a 1.5 times factor to set the dynamic stop loss distance, and the profit target is 2 times the stop loss distance (adjustable risk-return ratio).
3. Time filter allows users to set a specific time period for transactions and only execute transactions within the specified time range.
4. The transaction cooling period mechanism sets a waiting time of 10 cycles to prevent excessive trading.
5. The risk of each transaction is controlled at 1% of the account (adjustable).
#### Strategic Advantages
1. Dynamic risk management: Use the ATR indicator to adapt to market volatility and automatically adjust the stop loss and profit distance under different market environments.
2. Complete risk control: Systematic fund management is achieved by setting the risk-to-return ratio and the risk ratio of each transaction.
3. Flexible time management: Trading hours can be adjusted according to the characteristics of trading periods in different markets.
4. Prevent excessive trading: The cooling-off period mechanism effectively avoids excessive trading signals during periods of severe volatility.
5. Visualization effect: Transaction signals and moving averages are clearly displayed on the chart to facilitate analysis and optimization.
#### Strategy Risk
1. Trend reversal risk: In a volatile market, false breakthrough signals may occur, leading to continuous stop losses.
2. Parameter sensitivity: The selection of parameters such as moving average period and ATR multiple will significantly affect the strategy performance.
3. Improperly setting time filters may miss important trading opportunities.
4. A fixed risk-benefit ratio may not be flexible enough in different market environments.
#### Strategy optimization direction
1. Introducing a trend strength filter: ADX or similar indicators can be added to determine the trend strength and only trade during strong trends.
2. Dynamically adjust the risk-return ratio: Automatically adjust the risk-return ratio based on market volatility or trend strength.
3. Add trading volume analysis: Use trading volume as a supplementary indicator for signal confirmation.
4. Optimize the cooling-off period mechanism: dynamically adjust the length of the cooling-off period according to market volatility.
5. Add market environment classification: use different parameter combinations in different market environments.
#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete trading system by combining classic technical analysis methods and modern risk management concepts. Its core advantages lie in dynamic risk management and multiple filtering mechanisms, but it still needs parameter optimization based on specific market characteristics in practical applications. The successful operation of the strategy requires traders to deeply understand the role of each component and adjust parameters in a timely manner according to market changes. Through the suggested optimization direction, the strategy is expected to achieve more stable performance under different market environments. ||
#### Overview
This strategy is a trading system that combines dual moving average crossover signals with dynamic risk management. It generates trading signals through the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages while using the ATR indicator to dynamically adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels. The strategy also incorporates time filtering and a cooldown period to optimize trade quality, along with risk-reward ratio and per-trade risk percentage management mechanisms.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy is based on several core components:
1. The signal generation system uses the crossover of short-term (10-period) and long-term (100-period) simple moving averages to trigger trades. A buy signal is generated when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA, and vice versa.
2. The risk management system uses a 14-period ATR multiplied by 1.5 to set dynamic stop-loss distances, with the profit target being twice the stop-loss distance (adjustable risk-reward ratio).
3. A time filter allows users to set specific trading hours, executing trades only within the specified time range.
4. A trading cooldown mechanism sets a 10-period waiting time to prevent overtrading.
5. Risk per trade is controlled at 1% of the account (adjustable).

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dynamic Risk Management: Uses the ATR indicator to adapt to market volatility, automatically adjusting stop-loss and take-profit distances in different market conditions.
2. Comprehensive Risk Control: Achieves systematic money management through set risk-reward ratios and per-trade risk percentages.
3. Flexible Time Management: Can adjust trading hours according to different market characteristics.
4. Overtrading Prevention: Cooldown mechanism effectively prevents excessive trading signals during volatile periods.
5. Visualization: Clearly displays trading signals and moving averages on the chart for analysis and optimization.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Trend Reversal Risk: May generate false breakout signals in ranging markets, leading to consecutive stops.
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The choice of moving average periods, ATR multiplier, and other parameters significantly affects strategy performance.
3. Improper time filter settings may miss important trading opportunities.
4. Fixed risk-reward ratio may not be flexible enough for different market conditions.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce Trend Strength Filter: Add ADX or similar indicators to assess trend strength, trading only during strong trends.
2. Dynamic Risk-Reward Ratio Adjustment: Automatically adjust risk-reward ratio based on market volatility or trend strength.
3. Add Volume Analysis: Incorporate volume as a supplementary indicator for signal confirmation.
4. Optimize Cooldown Mechanism: Make cooldown period length dynamically adjust based on market volatility.
5. Implement Market Environment Classification: Use different parameter combinations in different market environments.

#### Summary
This strategy builds a complete trading system by combining classical technical analysis methods with modern risk management concepts. Its core advantages lie in dynamic risk management and multiple filtering mechanisms, but parameters still need to be optimized based on specific market characteristics in practical applications. Successful strategy operation requires traders to deeply understand the function of each component and adjust parameters timely according to market changes. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy has the potential to achieve more stable performance across different market environments.[/trans]
