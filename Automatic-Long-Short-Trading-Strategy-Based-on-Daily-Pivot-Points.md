## Overview
This strategy draws two lines based on the highest price and lowest price of the daily line as the basis for long and short judgments. When the price crosses the highest price line, go long; when the price crosses the lowest price line, go short. Can automatically switch between long and short.
## Strategy Principle
This strategy mainly uses the pivot point of the daily line to determine long and short positions. The so-called "pivot" is yesterday's highest price and lowest price. These two lines form a trading range. If today's price breaks through either of these two points, then it can be judged that the trend has turned.
Specifically, the main logic of the strategy is as follows:
1. Highest price line: Draw yesterday’s highest price horizontal line. If today’s closing price breaks through this line, it will be a bull signal.
2. Lowest price line: Draw yesterday’s lowest price horizontal line. If today’s closing price breaks through this line, it will be a short signal.
3. Long entry: When the closing price crosses the highest price line, open a long position
4. Short entry: When the closing price crosses the lowest price line, open a short position
5. Stop loss: Long stop loss is located near the lowest price line, and short stop loss is located near the highest price line.
In this way, the trend is captured through the breakthrough of the highest and lowest prices, and automatic long-short switching is achieved.
## Advantage Analysis
This strategy mainly has the following advantages:
1. The strategy is clear and easy to understand and implement.
2. Based on daily trading, the time period is long and it is not easily disturbed by short-term noise.
3. Automatically switch between long and short positions to avoid non-trending markets to the greatest extent
4. The stop loss point is clear, which is conducive to risk control
## Risk Analysis
There are also some risks with this strategy:
1. The daily trading time period is long and it is impossible to stop losses in time.
2. False breakthroughs may lead to unnecessary losses
3. Holding a position for too long may lead to expanded losses
In response to these risks, we can optimize from the following aspects:
1. When the daily line breaks through, add confirmation of other higher frequency indicators
2. Optimize the parameters for breakthrough determination and filter out some false breakthroughs
3. Use trailing stops or trailers to stop losses in time
## Optimization direction
There is room for further optimization of this strategy:
1. Backtesting can be conducted on more varieties and longer data to verify the stability of the strategy
2. You can explore the use of other breakthrough indicators, such as channels, Bollinger Bands, etc.
3. Can be combined with trading volume indicators to avoid unlimited breakthroughs
4. More filter conditions can be added to reduce the probability of false breakthroughs
5. You can try machine learning and other methods to optimize parameters.
## Summarize
In general, this strategy is based on a simple daily pivot idea and achieves automatic switching between long and short. The strategy logic is clear and easy to understand, and stability can be further improved through optimization. Investors can choose appropriate parameters for real trading based on their own risk preferences.

## Overview  

This strategy draws two lines based on the highest and lowest prices of daily candlesticks for judgments of long/short trends. It goes long when price breaks through the highest price line and goes short when price breaks through the lowest price line. It can automatically switch between long and short positions.

## Strategy Logic  

This strategy mainly utilizes the pivot points of daily candlesticks to determine long/short trends. The so-called "pivot points" refer to yesterday's highest and lowest prices. These two lines form a trading range. If today's price breaks through either of them, it indicates a reversal of the trend.   

Specifically, the main logic is as follows:  

1. Highest price line: Plot yesterday's highest price level. A break-through signals long trend.   
2. Lowest price line: Plot yesterday's lowest price level. A break-through signals short trend.
3. Long entry: Open long position when closing price breaks through highest price line.  
4. Short entry: Open short position when closing price breaks through lowest price line.   
5. Stop loss: Long stop loss near lowest price line, short stop loss near highest price line.  

By capturing trends through break-throughs of highest/lowest prices, it realizes automatic switching between long and short.  

## Advantage Analysis   

The main advantages of this strategy are:  

1. Simple logic, easy to understand and implement  
2. Based on daily bars, long cycle, less susceptible to short-term noises   
3. Automatic switch between long and short, avoid non-trending markets
4. Clear stop loss, beneficial for risk control  

## Risk Analysis   

Some risks:   

1. Daily bars have lower frequency, unable to stop loss timely  
2. Fake break-throughs may cause unnecessary losses  
3. Long holding may lead to expanded losses  

Improvements:

1. Add other higher frequency indicators for confirmation   
2. Optimize parameters to filter out fake break-throughs 
3. Adopt progressive stop loss methods for timely stop loss

## Optimization Directions  

Some directions:  

1. More backtesting on different products and longer datasets to test stability  
2. Explore other break-through indicators like channels, Bollinger Bands etc.  
3. Incorporate trading volume to avoid false breaks without volume  
4. Add more filters to reduce false breaks  
5. Utilize machine learning for parameter optimization  

## Summary  

In summary, this simple strategy realizes auto long/short based on daily pivots. The logic is clear and easy to understand. Further optimizations can improve stability. Investors can apply it to live trading based on personal risk preference.
